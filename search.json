    "section": "Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App",
    "text": "Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\nThe various data quality aspects ( Reporting completeness, Outlier detection,Internal Consistency Data completeness, Ratios calculation, Overall quality score) are are assessed in the Data quality section of the Shiny App.  The app will automatically compute the overall data quality score based on the metrics described above. The app will also produce a report with the results of the data quality assessment, including the numerators and denominators for each indicator, as well as the overall data quality score. []\nThere is often an inconsistency between antenatal and immunization data, even though we can argue that the two should be consistent. To examine the association between ANC1 and penta1 is particularly informative. To compute and interpret indicators 3a and 3b the following considerations need to be made:\nANC1 to penta1 ratio\nWe can compute an expected ratio ANC1 to penta1 based on assumptions about mortality between early to mid pregnancy and early infancy and survey data on coverage of ANC1 and penta1 in the population:\n\nConsider the mortality between the first ANC visit and the first pentavalent vaccination.\n\n\nAssuming that ANC1 takes place at about 20 weeks or 4-5 months of pregnancy and penta1 at 6-8 weeks postpartum, we assume a pregnancy loss (abortion) after the ANC1 visit of 3%, a stillbirth rate of 2%, a twinning rate of 1.5% and neonatal mortality rate before the penta1 of 3% then the difference between the numbers of ANC1 and penta1 should be: 1 – 0.03 – 0.02 + 0.015 – 0.03 = 0.935. This corresponds with a ANC1 to penta1 ratio of 1/0.935 = 1.07.\n\n\nActual population coverage of ANC1 and penta1 will also need to be considered, using the surveys.\n\n\nThe expected ratio (the number of ANC1/ number of penta1 in facilities) is 1.07 * (ANC1 coverage in the survey/penta1 coverage in the survey).\nIf coverage for ANC1 and penta1 are the same, then the ratio is 1.07 (1.07 * 1/1). But if, for example, the last survey shows that ANC1 coverage was 90% and penta1 coverage was 95%, then the expected ratio becomes 1.07 * (.90/.95) = 1.01.\n\n\nFor the national ANC1 to penta1 ratio a range of plus or minus 0.05 outside this computed ratio is considered acceptable. If the ratio is outside this range, this should be flagged, and possible explanations discussed.\n\nPenta1 to penta3 ratio\nWe can compute an expected penta1 to penta3 ratio based on the most recent survey:\n\nThe main factor determining the penta1 to penta3 ratio, which are recommended at 6 and at 14 weeks of age, is the actual drop-out rate between penta1 and penta3, as mortality plays a limited role.\nPopulation coverage rates from the latest survey are used to determine the expected penta1 to penta3 ratio in the facility data. For instance, if penta1 coverage is 95% and penta3 coverage is 85%, we expect that ratio to be 0.95/0.85 = 1.12.\nAlso, here a range of plus or minus 0.05 is considered acceptable for the assessment of the facility data.\n\nReport:\nPoints to consider for the interpretation\n\nIs there a data quality pattern by year for which there is an &gt; explanation? (include the explanation)\nAre there certain regions or other subnational units that are &gt; particularly problematic?\nAre there certain reporting forms or services (e.g., antenatal care, &gt; labour and delivery, immunization) that are problematic?\nIs there good consistency between reported numbers of ANC1 and &gt; penta1?\n\nThe Figure below produced in the ShinyApp shows the ratios for all six years (2019-2024) and the expected value. It will be important to reflect on large differences (e.g., more than 0.10 or 10%.).",

Extreme outliers, such as an accidental extra zero in a number, can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers. Following the assessments, several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for analysis. This implies adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers.\n\n\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nIf we do not consider reporting completeness that means we assume all non-reporting facilities provided zero services, which is not likely to be true. Adjustments depend on how much services (e.g., pregnancy care, vaccinations) were provided at non-reporting facilities compared to those that reported. The adjustment factor k - defined as the ratio of the volume of services provided by non-reporting facilities to the volume of services provided by reporting facilities - is used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting.",

The factor k can be different for different services. For instance, if private facility reporting is poor but they are in the national system and they provide a considerable number of deliveries, k maybe greater than 0.25 or even as high as 1.0.\nThe following k-values are used depending on the reporting used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting:\n\nk=0 - No services in non-reporting facilities (default k-value)\nk=0.25 - Some services, but much lower than reporting facilities\nk=0.50 - Half the rate compared to reporting facilities\nk=0.75 - Nearly as much as reporting facilities\nk= 1.0 - Same rate of services as reporting facilities\n\nIf the facility reporting rate is below 75%, it becomes more difficult to impute district data. Therefore, no adjustments are made if reporting is lower than 75%. In that case, further analysis to determine coverage with the facility data is not considered sufficiently reliable.\nExtreme outliers, as defined in the previous section, will be corrected by imputing the median monthly value of the same year.

Abnormal values are flagged:\n\nPopulation size:\nA relative difference between DHIS2 and UN-projected population size greater than 5% indicates a data quality issue.\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{\\text{pop}_{\\text{DHIS2}} - \\text{pop}_{\\text{UN}}}{\\text{pop}_{\\text{UN}}} \\right|\n\\]\nPopulation growth during 2023–2024:\nAnnual growth is computed using the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{\\text{pop}_{2024}}{\\text{pop}_{2023}} \\right)\n\\]\nA difference greater than 0.3% (absolute) between DHIS2 and UN estimates is concerning.\nCrude birth rate (CBR):\nDefined as: \\[\n\\frac{\\text{projected live births}}{\\text{total population}} \\times 1000\n\\]\nA difference greater than 5 per 1,000 population compared to the UN estimate suggests a data quality issue.\nCrude death rate (CDR):\nDefined as:\n\\[\n\\text{CBR} - \\text{population growth rate}\n\\]\n(both expressed per 1,000 population). A negative CDR or a CDR &lt; 5 per 1,000 indicates inconsistency and potential data problems.\n\n\n\nThe second part is to select the best performing denominator for population coverage estimates with facility data. First, we compare the results for different denominators at the national level.\nFor the national level, we evaluate 4 denominator methods. The first two are projection methods (DHIS2 estimate and UN estimate), and the additional two are facility data- based methods ( ANC1-derived and penta1-derived denominators).\nNote\n\nFor the sub-national level, no UN projections are available, so we will use 3 methods only.\n\nThe maternal and newborn health denominators are closely related and can be computed from each other by making assumptions.\nStarting with pregnancies, the number of live births is closely associated with the number of pregnancies, which are usually identified within the health system at the first antenatal visit which in most countries is around 4-5 months of pregnancy (according to the surveys). Country specific values are preferred where available and can be obtained from the WHO website. The default assumptions are as follows:\n\nPregnancy loss between 4 and 7 months (28 weeks of pregnancy): 3%.\nStillbirths or pregnancy loss between 28 weeks and birth: 2%.\nTwinning rate: 1.5%. These first three steps give the number of live births computed from pregnancies.\nNeonatal mortality: 3% (or 30 per 1,000 live births).\nPost neonatal mortality (between 1-11 months): 2.4% (or 24 per 1,000 live births).\n\nThe selection of the best performing denominator method is based on a comparison of the performance of the DHIS2 projection and facility-data derived methods for two indicators: institutional live births and penta3. The gold standard is the population coverage rates from a recent survey, for a year as close as possible. The absolute difference between survey and facility-based coverage at national and sub-national levels is used to select the best performing indicator. (This can also be expressed as the number of standard errors from the survey value but this requires including the standard errors from the surveys – the results will be the same).\n\nFacility data derived denominators\nThe basic idea is that if the coverage of an indicator is high (e.g., over 90%), then the number of events reported by health facilities has to be close to the target population. In other words, the denominators or target population can be derived from the numbers in DHIS2. The best candidate indicators for this approach are ANC1 and DPT/penta1 (BCG also possible in some countries if re-vaccinations are recorded separately).\nThis approach requires the following:\nA recent population-based survey is used to obtain an estimate of population level coverage of ANC1 or penta1. For example, ANC1 coverage is 95% of pregnant women.\nThe DHIS2 data on the number of ANC1 and penta1 visits need to be considered complete and accurate (after adjustments / cleaning the data). For example, 100,000 ANC1 visits were reported.\nIf this is the case, then we only need to add the percentage that has not used the services (according to the survey results) to get the target population. For example, if ANC1 coverage from survey is 95% and the number of ANC1 visits from DHIS2 for the year is 100,000, the total number of pregnant women is: \\[ 100,000 / 0.95 = 105,263 \\]\nThe same approach can be used for DPT1 or penta1. The survey coverage is the percent of children 12-23 months who received DPT1/penta1, the facility data are the number of infants who received DPT1/penta1 vaccination. For example, if survey coverage is 92%, and there were 100,000 vaccinations given, then the \\[ denominator= 100,000 / 0.92 = 108,696. \\]\nThe number of live births can be obtained from ANC1 and DPT1 by making assumptions about pregnancy loss (abortion after the first ANC visit, stillbirths), twinning rates, and neonatal mortality. These steps are shown in the Figure below. ![] (images/1-dqa_denom_adjustment.png)\nAn example of ANC1:\n\nAbove we computed 105,263 pregnant women in the population\nat 3% abortion, this implies 105,263 * (1-.0.03) = 102,454 deliveries\nat 1.5% twinning rate this implies 102,454 / (1-(0.015/2)) = 103,229 births\nat 2% stillbirth rate this implies 103,229 * (1-0.02) = 101,164 live births\nat 3% neonatal mortality this implies 101,164 * (1-0.03) = 98,129 children eligible for DPT1/penta1.",

Regular tracking of coverage at national and subnational levels has become the mainstay of monitoring progress in national health plans and international initiatives. Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health indicators with targets are the most common indicators of national health plans and global monitoring. Both health facility data and household surveys can provide coverage statistics, and an integrated analytical approach is desirable.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nMany coverage indicators can be estimated in both surveys and from health facility data. Both are critical pieces of information and need to be considered in conjunction with each other.

These coverage results should be compared and interpreted alongside the results from recent surveys. The analysis results will include both coverage estimates.\nImplementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\n\n\nAntenatal care (ANC)\nMost countries have at least one ANC indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage targets for 2025 are: globally, at least 90% of pregnant women with 4 or more ANC care visits, and 90% of countries with at least 70% coverage. There are several ANC indicators that capture:\n\ncontact with health services during pregnancy (ANC 1st visit, ANC 4 or more visits, ANC first visit in first trimester). ANC1 is often considered an indicator of basic access to health services. It is high in most countries, and in many instances, the numbers of ANC1 visits in the routine health facility data can provide a better denominator for the ANC and delivery indicators than population projections (see section 2 on denominators).\ncontents of services provided (intermittent preventive therapy (IPT2 or IPT3) against malaria, HIV testing, syphilis testing and iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation (at least 90 tablets given to the pregnant woman)). Some countries will not have policies for all of these diagnostic or therapeutic interventions during pregnancy (e.g., no IPT if no malaria risk).\n\nFor most indicators, the surveys also provide coverage estimates for the national level, with 95% confidence intervals. For most coverage indicators the data refer to a period before the survey: e.g., institutional birth coverage for the live births in the two years preceding the survey. This means that the midpoint of the coverage estimate lies one year before the survey.\nAn example of two graphs for ANC, based on facility and survey data, is shown below, showing both good concordance between the facility-based and survey results for coverage of ANC first visit in the first trimester and poor concordance in case of ANC4 visits. In the latter case, it is evident that ANC4 is overreported in the facility data as coverage is much higher than the survey and unlikely to be high (over 90% during 2021-23 and even 101% in 2023). Poor recording and reporting of ANC 4th visits in the DHIS2 data is likely the main cause.\nSometimes, an indicator may reach an unlikely high coverage at the national level, say over 125%. This may be because the data quality of the numerator of the coverage indicator is poor, the denominator is wrong, or the intervention is given and recorded more than once during pregnancy. An example is IFA supplementation. In that case, the computation of coverage is not useful. It is better to express it differently. For instance, if coverage is 200%, it is better to compute the average number of courses of 90 IFA tablets that a pregnant woman received (in this case 2.0 per pregnant woman in the population).1\n![] (images/2-national-anc-cov.png)\n\n\nDelivery care\nAll countries have at least one delivery care indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage target for 2025 is at least 90% global average coverage, and 90% of countries at least 80% coverage of skilled birth attendance (SBA). For postnatal care (PNC) within 2 days the global coverage target is 80% and the 90% of countries with at least 60% coverage.\nInstitutional (live) birth coverage and SBA are closely related, as almost all deliveries with a skilled attendant occur in health facilities. From the analytical point of view, institutional birth coverage is preferred because it is a more objective measure and avoids issues with the definition of what constitutes skilled birth. SBA is often preferred from the health care perspective, as it includes an element of quality: obviously, an institutional delivery without skilled attendance is not desirable, and in some countries home SBA may be part of the health care delivery strategy. attendance. Either indicator works well to capture delivery care.\nCaesarean section is a live saving intervention and an important indicator. A general rule of thumb is, put forward by WHO, that in a population the need for Caesarean section is in the range of 10-15% of all deliveries. If the Caesarean section rate is below 10%, that means that there is unmet need. If the Caesarean section rate is over 10-15%, that implies that there most likely overuse of Caesarean section. It may however also imply that there is still unmet need among certain population groups (e.g. the poorest women or rural women) in combination with overuse in other subgroups of the population (such as urban and richer women).\nPostnatal care (PNC) within 48 hours is provided to the mother/women and newborn. Country systems may have different ways of recording the type of PNC and also surveys are known to have data issues with PNC for the mother or the baby.2 Some countries use multiple definitions of timing of the PNC visit (e.g., within the first week).\nLow birthweight is a critical indicator of neonatal health. It is most meaningful if the distinction between prematurity and small-for-gestational age is made, but most facility reporting systems and most surveys do not have such data. All babies are supposed to have been weighed right after birth and the percent of newborns weighing less than 2500 grams is usually reported in the DHIS2 system. As general guidance for the interpretation of the data, low birthweight prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 13.9% (95% credibility interval: 12.4-15.7%) for 2020.3\n\n\nImmunization\nImmunization coverage indicators are included in virtually every country’s health sector monitoring plan. A general target is at least 90% coverage for essential vaccines given in childhood and adolescence.\nFor the national coverage analyses, the focus is on BCG, first and third doses of penta/DTP (penta1 or DTP1 and penta3 or DTP3), and first and second doses of measles vaccine, often given in combination with rubella vaccine. BCG and penta/DTP vaccinations are recommended to be given at birth (BCG), 6 weeks (penta1) and 14 weeks (penta3). For facility data, the number of vaccinations given to infants is used and the denominator is the number of eligible children in the population, which is approximated as live births minus neonatal deaths. Survey data generally provide vaccination coverage among children 12-23 months (may also include the age at which the vaccination was given – mostly before the first birthday).4\nThe first dose of measles vaccine is generally recommended at age 9 months. For the facility data, the recording and reporting usually separate measles given to children under 1 year and children 1 year and older, though the quality of recording and reporting for the age group may vary (there may be a tendency to record measles vaccinations after 12 months as given to infants). Here, we use children who have survived the first year of life (live births minus neonatal deaths minus postneonatal deaths) as the denominator for measuring vaccination coverage. The second dose of measles uses children aged 24-35 months as denominator. This can be estimated as live births minus neonatal deaths = 2* postneonatal deaths).\nWHO and UNICEF work with countries to produce annual estimates of immunization coverage based on all data sources. The national estimates, called WUENIC, are published and available for 2020-2024. These time trends are included in the Stata outputs, to compare the 2019-2023 annual estimates of the facility data produced in the workshop and the survey results.\n\n\nFamily planning\nThe family planning coverage estimates are derived from a collaboration of the Countdown with Track20. Track20 has developed an advanced estimation tool called Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) which focuses on three indicators: modern contraceptive use, unmet need for modern contraceptives and demand satisfied with modern methods. The three indicators are closely related since demand is satisfied (this is the true coverage indicator) = use of modern contraceptives / (unmet need + use of modern contraceptives).\nFPET uses statistical modelling that incorporates all available data from surveys and may also use estimates obtained from facility data if the quality is sufficient.5 FPET allows for various types of survey data to be integrated into the estimates and fits a line that pulls from the trends. This utilizes the strength of multiple data points and minimizes the risk of comparing different surveys.",

    "text": "Rationale, Approach and implementation\nRationale: Scientific basis for the analysis\nMaternal and perinatal mortality in health facilities are critical indicators of the quality of care (institutional mortality). Institutional maternal mortality is one of the key indicators proposed to monitor progress. Facility-based mortality statistics can also be a critical input into the estimation of population levels of mortality. Reporting of maternal deaths, stillbirths, and early neonatal deaths (before discharge) may occur through the routine reporting system (DHIS2, aggregate or individual level) or be part of a maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response system (MPDSR). \nPopulation mortality statistics (maternal mortality ratio, stillbirth rates, neonatal mortality rates) rely on household surveys and censuses, with major limitations, especially for maternal mortality and stillbirths.  A promising development is the major increase in health facility deliveries observed in many countries.  Especially if coverage of births in health facilities is high (e.g., over 75%), the facility-based statistics will become a useful input into the estimation of population levels of mortality.\nThe main challenge with mortality data from health facilities is underreporting of deaths. Maternal deaths do not only occur during birth, but also in pregnancy and post-partum. Reporting of stillbirth deaths requires well maintained maternity registers, but also cross-checks to the operation theatre registers for cases of Caesarean section. If that is not the case, deaths may not be recorded in the maternity register, and not reported into the national system. In addition, maternal deaths occurring in other hospital wards are more likely to be missed, such as deaths associated with abortion, or post-discharge due to sepsis and other causes. Neonatal deaths after discharge, which is often within 24 hours, are also more likely to be missed. A critical step is a systematic assessment of data quality issues, which forms the basis for, if possible, adjustments, and more importantly should guide efforts to improve reporting quality. \nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nData analysis has the following components: #1: Present and review the institutional maternal mortality ratio (iMMR) and stillbirth rates (iSBR) The annual mortality rates are computed using the unadjusted data on reported deaths and births/live births in health facilities. We do not adjust for reporting rates and outliers (as is done for other interventions) because it is difficult to adjust maternal deaths, and stillbirths, where the number of deaths is small and fluctuating. It is however advisable to check the data for any extreme outliers in the annual data (e.g., numbers of deaths that clearly indicate data entry errors) and replace these with the average of the surrounding years. The figure (5a) displays the institutional maternal mortality per 100,000 live births for regions (dots) and for the country as a whole (line and annual values) by year. Several considerations need to be made: Are there any extreme outliers on the high side which may be due to major data errors which need correction How many regions have implausibly low iMMR which is arbitrarily defined as less than 25 per 100,000 live births (25 is two times the MMR in high-income countries of 12.5); are these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or are there less-developed regions with low mortality, which could be an indication of major underreporting of deaths. A map with the iMMR by region/province would be a useful addition to guide the interpretation of the data, especially focusing on potential data quality issues.\n#Figure 5a: Institutional maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024\nhow many regions have implausibly low iSBR which is defined as less than 6 per 1,000 births (which is two times the SBR in high income countries); are these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or is this a sign of major underreporting of deaths in less-developed regions of the country.\n#Figure 5c: Institutional stillbirth rate per 1,000 births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024\nIn addition, the institutional mortality levels can be compared to the most recent mortality estimates for the population. These population estimates could be coming from a recent national survey or census, or we can use the UN estimates for maternal mortality (for 2020) and stillbirth rates (for 2021). This is to obtain an idea of the difference between the institutional mortality and the population mortality. How far is the iMMR (or iSBR) from the UN estimates of the population mortality, including the uncertainty range of the global estimates: this difference will be used further to assess the data quality. The institutional neonatal mortality rates (per 1,000 live births) based on reported neonatal deaths may also be graphed similar to iMMR and iSBR, but have to be interpreted with additional caution. Almost all babies stay at least 24 hours after delivery in the hospital but after that many are discharged and the observation time in health facilities is variable. Therefore, the statistic is mostly referred to as neonatal deaths before discharge per 1,000 live births, which includes day 1, some deaths on day 2, fewer deaths on day 3 etc. A rough guide to assess reporting completeness is that expected mortality of neonatal deaths before discharge in health facilities should be at least half of neonatal mortality in the population. So for instance, if population neonatal mortality is 20 per 1,000 live births, we expect institutional neonatal mortality at least 10 per 1,000 live births in the health facilities. #Figure 5d: Neonatal mortality before discharge per 1,000 live births in health facilities, based on DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions\n#2: Data quality metrics #Ratio stillbirth to maternal deaths in the health facility data at national level\nWe expect maternal mortality and stillbirth to be positively correlated given the commonalities in causes. Based on a review of the global estimates, historical data, and health facility studies, we expect the ratio of stillbirth to maternal death to be in the range of 7 to 30 for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We compute the ratio as the number of reported stillbirths divided by the number of reported maternal deaths in DHIS2 or MPDSR, in a specific time period (usually a year) and raise a “data quality flag” if the ratio is outside the 7-30 range. If the ratio is lower than 7: underreporting of stillbirths is likely greater than underreporting of maternal deaths If the ratio is equal or greater than 30: underreporting of maternal deaths is likely to be the main issue, underreporting of stillbirth less serious than for maternal deaths If the ratio is between 7 and 30: underreporting of maternal deaths and underreporting of stillbirths are both possible, or reporting of both is of good quality (this requires that the level is also in the expected range – component 1).\n#Figure 5b: Ratio of stillbirths to maternal deaths in health facilities, based on the reported data in DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions\nConsistency of institutional MMR with estimated population MMR and community MMR The completeness of reporting by health facilities can be estimated by comparing the reported iMMR based on facility data with an expected iMMR. The population MMR, community MMR and institutional MMR should be consistent. There will be variation in the community to institutional MMR between populations, but it is not likely that, for instance, the community MMR is 1000 when the institutional MMR is 100. We compute an expected MMR in health facilities based on assumptions about: MMR in the whole population (including community and institutional deaths). For example, the lower bound, median, upper bounds of global estimates for each country (2023 UN estimates) could be used, or the results from a recent survey.\nRatio of community to institutional maternal mortality. We use assumptions ranging from 1.0 (where we assume community MMR is the same as iMMR) to 2.0 and 3.0 (cMMR is 2 or 3 times higher than iMMR). For each country, one should consider what this ratio could be which may depend on the proportion of births in health facilities. There is some evidence that the community to institutional ratio increases as institutional birth rates increase. As well, as the observed percent of births in health facilities. The population MMR is the sum of the institutional and community MMR, weighted by the percent of births occurring in facilities. For instance, if the institutional MMR is 100 and the community MMR is 200, and 75% of births are in health facilities, then the population MMR equals 0.75 * 100 + 0.25 200 = 125 per 100,000 live births. This can be expressed in the following formula: Mp = maternal mortality ratio in the population; Mi = institutional maternal mortality ratio; Mc= maternal mortality ratio in the community; Pi the proportion of live births in institution, the population maternal mortality ratio can be estimated by: Mp=PiMi+1-PiMc Here, we have (1) iMMR from the DHIS2 data and (2) population mortality from the UN estimates, and can compute the community MMR as (125 - 0.75 100) / (1-0.25) = 200, or Mc= (Mp-PiMi)(1-Pi) In the example, the ratio community to institutional mortality (Mc/Mi) equals 200 / 100 = 2, in other words the community mortality is two times higher than the institutional mortality. We can now compute the expected MMR based on 1) an estimate of population MMR 2) the ratio Mc/Mi. For instance, if 75% delivers in health facilities, the population MMR is 200 and the ratio (Mc/Mi) is 2, then the expected institutional MMR is (200/(2-(2-1)0.75) = 200 / 1.25 = 160 per 100,000 live births. (and the community MMR is 320). In a formula: Expected Mi =Mp / (Mc/Mi – (Mc/Mi)-1) * Pi)) Finally, the completeness of facility reporting is reported iMMR (e.g. based on DHIS2) divided by the expected iMMR. For instance, if the reported MMR was 100 and the expected MMR 160, then the level of completeness of reporting is 100/160 * 100% = 62.5%. Below an example of the estimated completeness of facility reporting of maternal deaths using different scenarios. The figure shows the results on completeness of reporting with three levels of population MMR (lower bound, median or best estimate, upper bound) and three community to institutional mortality ratios (0.5-2.5), shown on the X-axis. Not all scenarios are equally relevant to each country. For instance, if there is evidence that the population MMR is lower than the UN median, pick the scenario with the lowest MMR (the blue line). If it is considered that community MMR could be 1.5-2.0 times higher than institutional MMR, then the completeness estimate is 59-64%. The choices are arbitrary, but it is useful to consider if the range of estimates of completeness of facility reporting can be narrowed down by using the most plausible scenario. As default values, the ratios of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 are used.\nA similar approach can be used for stillbirths using all births instead of live births. The UN global stillbirth estimates for 2021 with uncertainty ranges can be used (lower and upper bound are 90% uncertainty intervals from the model). There is little research on the community to institutional stillbirth ratio (partly because community level stillbirth reporting is more uncertain) but it is likely that the ratios are lower than for maternal mortality, as institutional mortality levels are much higher for stillbirth rates than for MMR. A range of 0.5-1.5 may be used for the estimation of the level of completeness of facility reporting.",

We do not adjust for reporting rates and outliers (as is done for other interventions) because it is difficult to adjust maternal deaths and stillbirths, where the number of deaths is small and fluctuating.3 It is however advisable to check the data for any extreme outliers in the annual data (e.g., numbers of deaths that clearly indicate data entry errors) and replace these with the average of the surrounding years.\nThe figure below displays the institutional maternal mortality per 100,000 live births for regions (dots) and for the country as a whole (line and annual values) by year.\n\n\n\nInstitutional maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024\n\n\nSeveral considerations need to be made:\n\nAre there any extreme outliers on the high side which may be due to major data errors which need correction?\nHow many regions have implausibly low iMMR which is arbitrarily defined as less than 25 per 100,000 live births (25 is two times the MMR in high-income countries of 12.5); are these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or are there less-developed regions with low mortality, which could be an indication of major underreporting of deaths.\nA map with the iMMR by region/province would be a useful addition to guide the interpretation of the data, especially focusing on potential data quality issues.\n\nThe figure below presents the stillbirth rate per 1,000 births for regions and the country, using the same format as for maternal mortality. The interpretation should explain:\n\nHow many regions have implausibly low iSBR which is defined as less than 6 per 1,000 births (which is two times the SBR in high income countries)?\nAre these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or is this a sign of major under-reporting of deaths in less-developed regions of the country.\n\n\n\nInstitutional stillbirth rate per 1,000 births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024\n\n\n\nIn addition, the institutional mortality levels can be compared to the most recent mortality estimates for the population. These population estimates could be coming from a recent national survey or census, or we can use the UN estimates for maternal mortality (for 2020) and stillbirth rates (for 2021).\nThis is to obtain an idea of the difference between the institutional mortality and the population mortality. Interpretation should seek to explain:\n\nHow far is the iMMR (or iSBR) from the UN estimates of the population mortality, including the uncertainty range of the global estimates: this difference will be used further to assess the data quality.\n\nThe institutional neonatal mortality rates (per 1,000 live births) based on reported neonatal deaths may also be graphed similar to iMMR and iSBR, but have to be interpreted with additional caution. Almost all babies stay at least 24 hours after delivery in the hospital but after that many are discharged and the observation time in health facilities is variable. Therefore, the statistic is mostly referred to as neonatal deaths before discharge per 1,000 live births, which includes day 1, some deaths on day 2, fewer deaths on day 3 etc.\nA rough guide to assess reporting completeness is that expected mortality of neonatal deaths before discharge in health facilities should be at least half of neonatal mortality in the population. So for instance, if population neonatal mortality is 20 per 1,000 live births, we expect institutional neonatal mortality at least 10 per 1,000 live births in the health facilities.\n\n\n\nNeonatal mortality before discharge per 1,000 live births in health facilities, based on DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions\n\n\n\n\nData Quality metrics\n\nRatio stillbirth to maternal deaths in the health facility data at national level\n\nWe expect maternal mortality and stillbirth to be positively correlated given the commonalities in causes. Based on a review of the global estimates, historical data, and health facility studies, we expect the ratio of stillbirth to maternal death to be in the range of 7 to 30 for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We compute the ratio as the number of reported stillbirths divided by the number of reported maternal deaths in DHIS2 or MPDSR, in a specific time period (usually a year) and raise a “data quality flag” if the ratio is outside the 7-30 range.\nInterpretation:\n\nIf the ratio is lower than 7: under-reporting of stillbirths is likely greater than under-reporting of maternal deaths\nIf the ratio is equal or greater than 30: under-reporting of maternal deaths is likely to be the main issue, under-reporting of stillbirth less serious than for maternal deaths.\nIf the ratio is between 7 and 30: under-reporting of maternal deaths and under-reporting of stillbirths are both possible, or reporting of both is of good quality (this requires that the level is also in the expected range - component 1).\n\n\n\n\nRatio of stillbirths to maternal deaths in health facilities, based on the reported data in DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions\n\n\n\nConsistency of institutional MMR with estimated population MMR and community MMR\n\nThe completeness of reporting by health facilities can be estimated by comparing the reported iMMR based on facility data with an expected iMMR. The population MMR, community MMR and institutional MMR should be consistent. There will be variation in the community to institutional MMR between populations, but it is not likely that, for instance, the community MMR is 1,000 when the institutional MMR is 100.\nWe compute an expected MMR in health facilities based on assumptions about:\n\nMMR in the whole population (including community and institutional deaths): For example, the lower bound, median, upper bounds of global estimates for each country (2023 UN estimates) could be used, or the results from a recent survey.\nRatio of community to institutional maternal mortality: We use assumptions ranging from 1.0 (where we assume community MMR is the same as iMMR) to 2.0 and 3.0 (cMMR is 2 or 3 times higher than iMMR).4 For each country, one should consider what this ratio could be which may depend on the proportion of births in health facilities. There is some evidence that the community to institutional ratio increases as institutional birth rates increases, as well as the observed percent of births in health facilities.\n\nThe population MMR is the sum of the institutional and community MMR, weighted by the percent of births occurring in facilities. For instance, if the institutional MMR is 100 and the community MMR is 200, and 75% of births are in health facilities, then the population MMR equals \\[ 0.75 * 100 + 0.25 *200 = 125  per 100,000 \\] live births. This can be expressed in the following formula:\n\\(M_{p} = P_{i}*M_{i} + \\left( 1 - P_{i} \\right)*M_{c}\\)\nWhere;\n\nMp = maternal mortality ratio in the population;\nMi = institutional maternal mortality ratio;\nMc= maternal mortality ratio in the community;\nPi the proportion of live births in institution\n\nHere, we have (1) iMMR from the DHIS2 data and (2) population mortality from the UN estimates, and can compute the community MMR as \\[(125 - 0.75 * 100) / (1-0.25) = 200 \\], or\n\\[ M_{c} =  \\frac{{(M}_{p} - {P_{i}*M}_{i})}{(1 - P_{i})}\\]\nIn the example, the ratio community to institutional mortality \\[(Mc/Mi) \\]equals 200 / 100 = 2, in other words the community mortality is two times higher than the institutional mortality.\nWe can now compute the expected MMR based on 1) an estimate of population MMR 2) the ratio Mc/Mi. For instance, if 75% delivers in health facilities, the population MMR is 200 and the ratio (Mc/Mi) is 2, then the expected institutional MMR is \\[ (200/(2-(2-1)*0.75) = 200 / 1.25 = 160 per 100,000 \\] live births. (and the community MMR is \\[320\\] ).\nIn a formula:5\n\nExpected \\[Mi =Mp / (Mc/Mi -- (Mc/Mi)-1) * Pi))\\]\n\nFinally, the completeness of facility reporting is reported iMMR (e.g. based on DHIS2) divided by the expected iMMR. For instance, if the reported MMR was 100 and the expected MMR 160, then the level of completeness of reporting is \\[100/160 * 100% = 62.5%.\\]\nBelow is an example of the estimated completeness of facility reporting of maternal deaths using different scenarios. The figure shows the results on completeness of reporting with three levels of population MMR (lower bound, median or best estimate, upper bound) and three community to institutional mortality ratios (0.5-2.5), shown on the X-axis.\nNot all scenarios are equally relevant to each country. For instance, if there is evidence that the population MMR is lower than the UN median, pick the scenario with the lowest MMR (the blue line). If it is considered that community MMR could be 1.5-2.0 times higher than institutional MMR, then the completeness estimate is 59-64%. The choices are arbitrary, but it is useful to consider if the range of estimates of completeness of facility reporting can be narrowed down by using the most plausible scenario. As default values, the ratios of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 are used.\n\nA similar approach can be used for stillbirths using all births instead of live births. The UN global stillbirth estimates for 2021 with uncertainty ranges can be used (lower and upper bound are 90% uncertainty intervals from the model). There is little research on the community to institutional stillbirth ratio (partly because community level stillbirth reporting is more uncertain) but it is likely that the ratios are lower than for maternal mortality, as institutional mortality levels are much higher for stillbirth rates than for MMR. A range of 0.5-1.5 may be used for the estimation of the level of completeness of facility reporting.",

    "text": "Rationale, Approach and implementation\nRationale: Scientific basis for the analysis\nThere is only limited information about curative service utilization, even though diarrhoea and pneumonia are leading causes of death in children. Service utilization statistics on care-seeking behaviour among children with recent illnesses (diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, or fever in the last 2 weeks) is usually obtained from household surveys, relying on mother’s recall.\nHealth facility data on outpatient (OPD) visits is an indicator of access to curative services: less than one visit per person is often considered an indicator of poor access. Similarly, data on hospital admissions is an indicator of access to services, while hospital mortality (case fatality) is an indicator of the quality of care.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nThe data on OPD visits should include new and re-visits. Data are usually reported for under-5 years and 5 years and older. As with data on maternal and newborn care and immunization, the data quality is assessed, and adjustments are made for completeness of reporting and extreme outliers are corrected. The adjusted clean data are used for analysis at national and subnational levels.\n\n\nOutpatient service utilization\nThe data on outpatient visits should include both new and re-visits.\nMean number of OPD visits per child per year:\n\nThe numerator is the adjusted number of under-5 OPD visits in a year and the denominator is the total number of children under-5 which is taken from the DHIS2 projections. We do not expect this statistic to change much between years (less than 0.2 visits per child per year). A gradual increase suggests either improvements in access to OPD services or a greater disease burden for children. There is no fixed cut-off, but if the attendance is less than 1 visit per year per child, access to services is likely an issue. The OPD statistics are computed for the national and regional/provincial levels.\nA map with OPD use by region or province can reveal important sub-national differences.\nRegarding the interpretations for OPD:\n\nWhat can be said about the data quality for OPD visits? Is there consistency of reported numbers between years?\nWhat is the number of OPD visits per child per year during 2019-2023, is it increasing?\nIs it lower than 1 visit per year, which is considered indicative of low access?\nWhat can be said about the OPD visits per child per year by region/province in 2023? How large is the difference between top and bottom regions?\n\n\n**Insert pic\nThe percentage commonly lies between 15-45% of all visits that are under-fives. In high fertility countries (e.g., total fertility rate &gt; 4) we expect a higher percentage (e.g., over 30%) than in lower fertility countries. If the percent lies outside this range, there may be a data quality problem. Furthermore, if the percent changes much between years (e.g. more than 5 percentage points) then there may also be a data quality issue.\n**Insert pic\n\n\nInpatient service utilization\nThe data on hospital admissions (or discharges + deaths) include new and re-admissions. Data are usually reported for under-5 and 5 years and over. Some countries report discharges rather than admissions which would be the preferred data (discharges = admissions – deaths).\nA review of completeness of reporting and the presence of extreme outliers is used to assess data quality. Reporting rates of hospitals (and other facilities with in-patient services) may be more difficult to assess than for other services. Therefore, the decision to adjust for incomplete reporting also depends on the judgement by the country teams regarding the quality of the reporting rate for in-patient services.\nAlso, extreme outliers may be more common for monthly admissions because of poor reporting, and adjustments need to be made cautiously. It is recommended to assess both the unadjusted and adjusted results.\nNumber of admissions per 100 children under-5 per year:\n\nThis is an indicator of access. A low value, e.g., less than 2 admissions per 100 children under-5 per year, is indicative of low access to services. The median for countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2018-2022 was 4.5 admissions per year. Also here, we do not expect the indicator to change much per year: e.g. a change of 1 or more admissions per 100 children between years is unlikely, unless a specific explanation can be found (such as an epidemic).\nA map with IPD admissions among under-five use by region or province can reveal important sub-national differences.\nRegarding the interpretations for IPD:\n\nIs there consistency of reported numbers of admissions / admission rates over time?\nWhat is the number of admissions per 100 children under 5 per year during 2019-2023?\nTrend - Is it low or high? What can be said about admissions per 100 children under-5 per year by region/province in 2023?\n\n\nCase fatality rate:\nAn indicator of the quality of care, defined as the number of children who die in hospital divided by the total number admitted (discharges + deaths). This should be done using the unadjusted data, as we do not adjust: neither the numbers of deaths nor the number of admissions. The case fatality rate is considered an indicator of the quality of care. The lower the mortality in health facilities, the better the quality of care.\n**insert pic\nPercent of admissions that are children under five:\nan indicator of data quality. The percentage commonly lies between 10-40% of all admissions that are under-fives. If the percentage lies outside this range, there may be a data quality problem or an exceptional situation. Furthermore, if the percent changes much between years (e.g. more than 5 percentage points), then there may also be a data quality issue.",

For selected indicators, the assessment should focus on:\nNo health financing indicator:\nHealth financing indicators at the district or admin1 levels are difficult to obtain and are often limited to budget and not expenditures. The data also tends to be limited to government resources and may miss on other sources of financing. (These data are not used here, but if available, the financial data should be used to assess health system inputs.)\nCore health professionals per 10,000 population:\nHealth workforce indicators are often of poor quality and not easy to obtain. The main indicator is the number of core health professionals per 10,000 population. These include physicians, non-physician clinicians (depending on the country, but often with surgical skills and multiple years of training but no academic degree), nurses and midwives.\nIn 2006, WHO suggested that at least 23 core health professionals were needed to make major progress in reducing maternal and child mortality with high skilled birth attendance. More recently, higher thresholds have been used: at least 44.5 per 10,000 population to achieve universal health coverage.\nNumber of health facilities per 10,000 population:\nHealth infrastructure is another useful indicator, including all hospitals, health centers and lower level health facilities such as health posts and dispensaries.

    "text": "Rationale, Approach and implementation\nRationale: Scientific basis for the analysis\nThe private sector plays a significant role in delivering RMNCH (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health) services, although its contribution varies both between and within countries. While routine health facility data are intended to capture private sector service delivery—such as the number of deliveries or family planning visits—this information is often incomplete, as reporting from private facilities tends to be less consistent than from public ones. Ideally, all private facilities should be included in the master facility list, but this is frequently not the case.\nTo estimate the private sector’s contribution more accurately, survey data such as those from DHS and MICS can be used. These surveys include questions about the source of health services, distinguishing between public and private providers.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nIn this analysis, we use three key indicators to assess the private sector’s role at the national level and disaggregated by urban and rural residence.\nThe three indicators are:\n\nDeliveries: Percent of live births occurring in health facilities among all live births in the last two years, by public private; with the share that is private\nSurgical interventions: Percent of C-sections that occur in health facilities among all live births in the last two years, by public private; with the share that is private\nCurative care for children: Percent of children under-five who have sought care for fever, acute respiratory illness or diarrhoea in the last two weeks before the interview, by public private; with the share that is private\n\nIt is generally expected that women and children in urban areas rely more on privately provided services than those in rural areas.\nThere are, however, two caveats to the interpretation:\n\nRural women may use private services located in urban areas, which means that the percentage of women / children is overestimated for rural residents.\nThe distinction between private-for-profit and non-profit private facilities is not made in this analysis. Each country uses a different classification and naming convention, and also for the survey respondent this distinction is difficult to make.\n\nImplementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\nThis can be analyzed using the Health System Performance tab -&gt; Private sector as shown in ?fig-hs_performance.",
