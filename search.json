    "text": "1.1 Installing R and RStudio\nTo begin working in R, it is necessary to install both R and RStudio. R is the underlying programming language, while RStudio provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the development and execution of R scripts. Both are freely available and widely supported across platforms.\n\n1.1.1 Download and Install R (Step 1)\nR is distributed via The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Select your operating system from the homepage: Windows, Mac, or Linux.\n\n1.1.1.1 Windows\n\nNavigate to Download R for Windows and select the “base” option.\nClick the first link (e.g., “Download R x.x.x for Windows”) to download the installer.\nRun the installer and follow the prompts. Administrator privileges may be required.\nR will be installed in your system’s Program Files, with a shortcut added to the Start menu.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.2 Mac\n\nClick Download R for Mac on the CRAN homepage.\nDownload the latest release package and run the installer.\nThe default installation settings are typically sufficient. You may be prompted to enter your system password.\n\n\nR is not a graphical software application but a programming environment. It is best used in conjunction with RStudio, which provides a consistent and user-friendly interface across operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Install RStudio (Step 2)\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for R. It features a script editor, console, graphics viewer, and additional tools for package management, debugging, and file organization.\nDownload RStudio from Posit Website\nDo I still need to download R? Even if you use RStudio, you’ll still need to download R to your computer. RStudio helps you use the version of R that lives on your computer, but it doesn’t come with a version of R on its own.\nAfter installation, launch RStudio and begin interacting with R through its console and script windows.",
