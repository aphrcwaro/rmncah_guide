Data needs to be checked to consider completeness of reporting by health facilities, identify extreme outliers and internal consistency. A standard reporting method for data quality allows assessment of progress over time.\n\n\n5.1.2 Approach: Description of analytical steps\nThe analysis of the monthly data by district for 2019-2024 is used to assess annual data quality using the following standard indicators:",

    "text": "5.2 Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\nThe various data quality aspects ( Reporting completeness, Outlier detection,Internal Consistency Data completeness, Ratios calculation, Overall quality score) are are assessed in the Data quality section of the Shiny App.  The app will automatically compute the overall data quality score based on the metrics described above. The app will also produce a report with the results of the data quality assessment, including the numerators and denominators for each indicator, as well as the overall data quality score. []\nThere is often an inconsistency between antenatal and immunization data, even though we can argue that the two should be consistent. To examine the association between ANC1 and penta1 is particularly informative. To compute and interpret indicators 3a and 3b the following considerations need to be made:\nANC1 to penta1 ratio\nWe can compute an expected ratio ANC1 to penta1 based on assumptions about mortality between early to mid pregnancy and early infancy and survey data on coverage of ANC1 and penta1 in the population:\n\nConsider the mortality between the first ANC visit and the first pentavalent vaccination.\n\n\nAssuming that ANC1 takes place at about 20 weeks or 4-5 months of pregnancy and penta1 at 6-8 weeks postpartum, we assume a pregnancy loss (abortion) after the ANC1 visit of 3%, a stillbirth rate of 2%, a twinning rate of 1.5% and neonatal mortality rate before the penta1 of 3% then the difference between the numbers of ANC1 and penta1 should be: 1 – 0.03 – 0.02 + 0.015 – 0.03 = 0.935. This corresponds with a ANC1 to penta1 ratio of 1/0.935 = 1.07.\n\n\nActual population coverage of ANC1 and penta1 will also need to be considered, using the surveys.\n\n\nThe expected ratio (the number of ANC1/ number of penta1 in facilities) is 1.07 * (ANC1 coverage in the survey/penta1 coverage in the survey).\nIf coverage for ANC1 and penta1 are the same, then the ratio is 1.07 (1.07 * 1/1). But if, for example, the last survey shows that ANC1 coverage was 90% and penta1 coverage was 95%, then the expected ratio becomes 1.07 * (.90/.95) = 1.01.\n\n\nFor the national ANC1 to penta1 ratio a range of plus or minus 0.05 outside this computed ratio is considered acceptable. If the ratio is outside this range, this should be flagged, and possible explanations discussed.\n\nPenta1 to penta3 ratio\nWe can compute an expected penta1 to penta3 ratio based on the most recent survey:\n\nThe main factor determining the penta1 to penta3 ratio, which are recommended at 6 and at 14 weeks of age, is the actual drop-out rate between penta1 and penta3, as mortality plays a limited role.\nPopulation coverage rates from the latest survey are used to determine the expected penta1 to penta3 ratio in the facility data. For instance, if penta1 coverage is 95% and penta3 coverage is 85%, we expect that ratio to be 0.95/0.85 = 1.12.\nAlso, here a range of plus or minus 0.05 is considered acceptable for the assessment of the facility data.\n\nReport:\nPoints to consider for the interpretation\n\nIs there a data quality pattern by year for which there is an &gt; explanation? (include the explanation)\nAre there certain regions or other subnational units that are &gt; particularly problematic?\nAre there certain reporting forms or services (e.g., antenatal care, &gt; labour and delivery, immunization) that are problematic?\nIs there good consistency between reported numbers of ANC1 and &gt; penta1?\n\nThe Figure below produced in the ShinyApp shows the ratios for all six years (2019-2024) and the expected value. It will be important to reflect on large differences (e.g., more than 0.10 or 10%.).",

Extreme outliers, such as an accidental extra zero in a number, can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers. Following the assessments, several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for analysis. This implies adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers.\n\n\n6.1.2 Approach: Description of analytical steps\nIf we do not consider reporting completeness that means we assume all non-reporting facilities provided zero services, which is not likely to be true. Adjustments depend on how much services (e.g., pregnancy care, vaccinations) were provided at non-reporting facilities compared to those that reported. The adjustment factor k - defined as the ratio of the volume of services provided by non-reporting facilities to the volume of services provided by reporting facilities - is used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting.",

    "text": "6.2 Adjusting the Numerator Using Completeness and Facility Reporting Ratio\nTo account for incomplete reporting, the reported number of events can be adjusted using the following formula:\n\\[\nN_{\\text{adjusted}} = N_{\\text{reported}} + N_{\\text{reported}} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{c} - 1 \\right) \\times k\n\\]\nWhere: - ( N_{} ): Total number of events adjusted for incomplete reporting - ( N_{} ): Number of events reported\n- ( c ): Reporting completeness (e.g., proportion of facilities that reported)\n- ( k ): Adjustment factor to account for lower service volume in non-reporting facilities\nAs a default value, we use k=0.25, which means the non-reporting facilities provided services but only at a volume which was a quarter of the reporting health facilities. The factor k can be different for different services. For instance, if private facility reporting is poor but they are in the national system and they provide a considerable number of deliveries, k maybe greater than 0.25 or even as high as 1.0.\nThe following k-values are used depending on the reporting used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting:\n\nk=0 - No services in non-reporting facilities (default k-value)\nk=0.25 - Some services, but much lower than reporting facilities\nk=0.50 - Half the rate compared to reporting facilities\nk=0.75 - Nearly as much as reporting facilities\nk= 1.0 - Same rate of services as reporting facilities\n\nIf the facility reporting rate is below 75%, it becomes more difficult to impute district data. Therefore, no adjustments are made if reporting is lower than 75%. In that case, further analysis to determine coverage with the facility data is not considered sufficiently reliable.\nExtreme outliers, as defined in the previous section, will be corrected by imputing the median monthly value of the same year.

This should lead to a final decision on denominators that are used for the analyses of population-based coverage indicators based on health facility data.\nEach indicator has its own denominator, as shown in the table below.\nTable 3: Selected indicators with numerators and denominators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators\nNumerator\nDenominator\n\n\n\n\nSERVICE UTILIZATION\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient visits, children under 5, per year (N)\nN of OPD visits for under-5\nTotal mid-year population under 5\n\n\nInpatient admissions, children under 5, per year (N)\nN of admissions for under-5\nTotal mid-year population under 5\n\n\nPREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS\n\n\n\n\n% of pregnant women with 4 antenatal care visits\nN of women with ANC 4th visit\nTotal N of pregnant women in the whole population\n\n\n% of live births in health facilities\nN of live births in health facilities\nTotal N of live births in the whole population\n\n\n% of infants receiving 3 doses of pentavalent vaccine\nN of infants receiving 3 doses\nN of infants eligible for 3 doses of the vaccine\n\n\nCURATIVE INTERVENTIONS\n\n\n\n\n% of children under 5 with malaria who receive ACT\nN of children under 5 with malaria receiving ACT\nTotal N of children who had malaria in the last year\n\n\n% of deliveries that were by C-section (population)\nN of C-sections reported\nTotal N of deliveries in the population\n\n\n% of deliveries that were by C-section (institutional)\nN of C-sections reported\nTotal N of deliveries in health facilities\n\n\nMORTALITY\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional maternal mortality ratio\nN of maternal deaths in health facilities\nTotal number of live births in health facilities\n\n\nStillbirth rate\nN of stillbirths in health facilities\nTotal N of births in health facilities\n\n\nNeonatal mortality before discharge\nN of neonatal deaths before discharge (after birth)\nTotal N of live births in the health facilities\n\n\nFAMILY PLANNING (FP)\n\n\n\n\nRatio FP visits to women of reproductive age\nN of FP new and revisits\nTotal N of women 15-49 years\n\n\nEstimated modern use of contraceptives\nCouple years of protection\nTotal N of women 15-49 years\n\n\nFP coverage (demand satisfied)\nN of women using modern methods\nTotal N of women in need of FP\n\n\n\nIn the first part, we assess the quality of the DHIS2 population projections at national level:\n\nCheck the internal consistency of the DHIS2 population growth over time:\n\nCompute the population growth rate:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{pop}_{2024} - \\text{pop}_{2023}}{\\text{pop}_{2023}}\n\\]\nCompute the crude birth rate (CBR), defined as the number of live births per 1,000 population.\nExpect both growth rate and CBR to be consistent over time (e.g., less than 2 per 1,000 difference between years).\n\nCompare the population data in DHIS2 with the UN population projections at the national level:\n\nDifferences may occur, but large discrepancies suggest issues with DHIS2 population projections.\nThe comparison is done for four indicators. Abnormal values are flagged:\n\nPopulation size:\nA relative difference between DHIS2 and UN-projected population size greater than 5% indicates a data quality issue.\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{\\text{pop}_{\\text{DHIS2}} - \\text{pop}_{\\text{UN}}}{\\text{pop}_{\\text{UN}}} \\right|\n\\]\nPopulation growth during 2023–2024:\nAnnual growth is computed using the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{\\text{pop}_{2024}}{\\text{pop}_{2023}} \\right)\n\\]\nA difference greater than 0.3% (absolute) between DHIS2 and UN estimates is concerning.\nCrude birth rate (CBR):\nDefined as: \\[\n\\frac{\\text{projected live births}}{\\text{total population}} \\times 1000\n\\]\nA difference greater than 5 per 1,000 population compared to the UN estimate suggests a data quality issue.\nCrude death rate (CDR):\nDefined as:\n\\[\n\\text{CBR} - \\text{population growth rate}\n\\]\n(both expressed per 1,000 population). A negative CDR or a CDR &lt; 5 per 1,000 indicates inconsistency and potential data problems.\n\n\n\nThe second part is to select the best performing denominator for population coverage estimates with facility data. First, we compare the results for different denominators at the national level.\nFor the national level, we evaluate 4 denominator methods. The first two are projection methods (DHIS2 estimate and UN estimate), and the additional two are facility data- based methods ( ANC1-derived and penta1-derived denominators).\nNote\n\nFor the sub-national level, no UN projections are available, so we will use 3 methods only.\n\nThe maternal and newborn health denominators are closely related and can be computed from each other by making assumptions.\nStarting with pregnancies, the number of live births is closely associated with the number of pregnancies, which are usually identified within the health system at the first antenatal visit which in most countries is around 4-5 months of pregnancy (according to the surveys). Country specific values are preferred where available and can be obtained from the WHO website. The default assumptions are as follows:\n\nPregnancy loss between 4 and 7 months (28 weeks of pregnancy): 3%.\nStillbirths or pregnancy loss between 28 weeks and birth: 2%.\nTwinning rate: 1.5%. These first three steps give the number of live births computed from pregnancies.\nNeonatal mortality: 3% (or 30 per 1,000 live births).\nPost neonatal mortality (between 1-11 months): 2.4% (or 24 per 1,000 live births).\n\nThe selection of the best performing denominator method is based on a comparison of the performance of the DHIS2 projection and facility-data derived methods for two indicators: institutional live births and penta3. The gold standard is the population coverage rates from a recent survey, for a year as close as possible. The absolute difference between survey and facility-based coverage at national and sub-national levels is used to select the best performing indicator. (This can also be expressed as the number of standard errors from the survey value but this requires including the standard errors from the surveys – the results will be the same).\n\n7.2.1 Facility data derived denominators\nThe basic idea is that if the coverage of an indicator is high (e.g., over 90%), then the number of events reported by health facilities has to be close to the target population. In other words, the denominators or target population can be derived from the numbers in DHIS2. The best candidate indicators for this approach are ANC1 and DPT/penta1 (BCG also possible in some countries if re-vaccinations are recorded separately).\nThis approach requires the following:\nA recent population-based survey is used to obtain an estimate of population level coverage of ANC1 or penta1. For example, ANC1 coverage is 95% of pregnant women.\nThe DHIS2 data on the number of ANC1 and penta1 visits need to be considered complete and accurate (after adjustments / cleaning the data). For example, 100,000 ANC1 visits were reported.\nIf this is the case, then we only need to add the percentage that has not used the services (according to the survey results) to get the target population. For example, if ANC1 coverage from survey is 95% and the number of ANC1 visits from DHIS2 for the year is 100,000, the total number of pregnant women is: \\[ 100,000 / 0.95 = 105,263 \\]\nThe same approach can be used for DPT1 or penta1. The survey coverage is the percent of children 12-23 months who received DPT1/penta1, the facility data are the number of infants who received DPT1/penta1 vaccination. For example, if survey coverage is 92%, and there were 100,000 vaccinations given, then the \\[ denominator= 100,000 / 0.92 = 108,696. \\]\nThe number of live births can be obtained from ANC1 and DPT1 by making assumptions about pregnancy loss (abortion after the first ANC visit, stillbirths), twinning rates, and neonatal mortality. These steps are shown in the Figure below. ![] (images/1-dqa_denom_adjustment.png)\nAn example of ANC1:\n\nAbove we computed 105,263 pregnant women in the population\nat 3% abortion, this implies 105,263 * (1-.0.03) = 102,454 deliveries\nat 1.5% twinning rate this implies 102,454 / (1-(0.015/2)) = 103,229 births\nat 2% stillbirth rate this implies 103,229 * (1-0.02) = 101,164 live births\nat 3% neonatal mortality this implies 101,164 * (1-0.03) = 98,129 children eligible for DPT1/penta1.",

Regular tracking of coverage at national and subnational levels has become the mainstay of monitoring progress in national health plans and international initiatives. Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health indicators with targets are the most common indicators of national health plans and global monitoring. Both health facility data and household surveys can provide coverage statistics, and an integrated analytical approach is desirable.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nMany coverage indicators can be estimated in both surveys and from health facility data. Both are critical pieces of information and need to be considered in conjunction with each other. The Table below lists the indicators, for antenatal and delivery care and child immunization, considered in the health facility data analysis in the workshop, including the variable names (in R) in the first column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName (in R)\nIndicator title\nSurvey d enomin ator\nFacility data den ominator\n\n\n\n\nAntenatal care\n\n\n\n\n\nanc1\nAntenatal care at least one or more visits among all pregnant women (%)\nWomen aged 15-49 years with a live birth in the last 2 years\nEstimated live births as d enominator\n\n\nanc_1 trimester\nAntenatal care 1+ visits in 1st trimester of pregnancy among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nanc4\nAntenatal care 4+ visits among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nipt2\nipt3\nIntermittent preventive therapy for malaria - 2nd dose / 3rd dose during pregnancy among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nifa90\nIron folic acid supplementation given (90 days supply) during pregnancy among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nhiv_test\nHIV test conducted among pregnant women (%)\nNot available (in some survey re ports)\n\n\n\nsyph ilis_test\nSyphilis test conducted among pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nDelivery care\n\n\n\n\n\ninstd eliveries\nInstitutional live births among all live births\nLive births in the last 2 years\nEstimated live births as de nominator.\n\n\nsba\nSkilled birth attendance\n\n\n\n\nlo w_bweight\nLow birth weight (below 2500 grams) among all live births\n\n\n\n\ncsection\nC-section among all live births\n\n\n\n\npnc48h\nPostnatal care within 48 hours\n\n\n\n\nImmunization\n\n\n\n\n\nbcg\nBCG vaccination to infants\nChildren 12-23 months\nN of surviving infants (beyond neonatal period)\n\n\npenta1\nPenta vaccine - 1st dose to infants\nChildren 12-23 months\n\n\n\npenta3\nPenta vaccine - 3rd dose to infants\nChildren 12-23 months\n\n\n\nmeasles1\nMeasles vaccine - 1st dose (to infants)\nChildren 12-23 months\nN of surviving infants (beyond postNN period)\n\n\nmeasles2\nMeasles vaccine - 1st dose (older children)\nChildren 24-35 months\nN of surviving infants (beyond po stneonatal period) (or age 1)\n\n\n\nThe facility data can be used to generate annual coverage estimates, using the dataset for 2019-2024, through the Shiny App developed. These coverage results should be compared and interpreted alongside the results from recent surveys. The analysis results will include both coverage estimates.\nImplementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\n\n\n8.1.2 Antenatal care (ANC)\nMost countries have at least one ANC indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage targets for 2025 are: globally, at least 90% of pregnant women with 4 or more ANC care visits, and 90% of countries with at least 70% coverage. There are several ANC indicators that capture:\n\ncontact with health services during pregnancy (ANC 1st visit, ANC 4 or more visits, ANC first visit in first trimester). ANC1 is often considered an indicator of basic access to health services. It is high in most countries, and in many instances, the numbers of ANC1 visits in the routine health facility data can provide a better denominator for the ANC and delivery indicators than population projections (see section 2 on denominators).\ncontents of services provided (intermittent preventive therapy (IPT2 or IPT3) against malaria, HIV testing, syphilis testing and iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation (at least 90 tablets given to the pregnant woman)). Some countries will not have policies for all of these diagnostic or therapeutic interventions during pregnancy (e.g., no IPT if no malaria risk).\n\nFor most indicators, the surveys also provide coverage estimates for the national level, with 95% confidence intervals. For most coverage indicators the data refer to a period before the survey: e.g., institutional birth coverage for the live births in the two years preceding the survey. This means that the midpoint of the coverage estimate lies one year before the survey.\nAn example of two graphs for ANC, based on facility and survey data, is shown below, showing both good concordance between the facility-based and survey results for coverage of ANC first visit in the first trimester and poor concordance in case of ANC4 visits. In the latter case, it is evident that ANC4 is overreported in the facility data as coverage is much higher than the survey and unlikely to be high (over 90% during 2021-23 and even 101% in 2023). Poor recording and reporting of ANC 4th visits in the DHIS2 data is likely the main cause.\nSometimes, an indicator may reach an unlikely high coverage at the national level, say over 125%. This may be because the data quality of the numerator of the coverage indicator is poor, the denominator is wrong, or the intervention is given and recorded more than once during pregnancy. An example is IFA supplementation. In that case, the computation of coverage is not useful. It is better to express it differently. For instance, if coverage is 200%, it is better to compute the average number of courses of 90 IFA tablets that a pregnant woman received (in this case 2.0 per pregnant woman in the population).1\n![] (images/2-national-anc-cov.png)\n\n\n8.1.3 Delivery care\nAll countries have at least one delivery care indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage target for 2025 is at least 90% global average coverage, and 90% of countries at least 80% coverage of skilled birth attendance (SBA). For postnatal care (PNC) within 2 days the global coverage target is 80% and the 90% of countries with at least 60% coverage.\nInstitutional (live) birth coverage and SBA are closely related, as almost all deliveries with a skilled attendant occur in health facilities. From the analytical point of view, institutional birth coverage is preferred because it is a more objective measure and avoids issues with the definition of what constitutes skilled birth. SBA is often preferred from the health care perspective, as it includes an element of quality: obviously, an institutional delivery without skilled attendance is not desirable, and in some countries home SBA may be part of the health care delivery strategy. attendance. Either indicator works well to capture delivery care.\nCaesarean section is a live saving intervention and an important indicator. A general rule of thumb is, put forward by WHO, that in a population the need for Caesarean section is in the range of 10-15% of all deliveries. If the Caesarean section rate is below 10%, that means that there is unmet need. If the Caesarean section rate is over 10-15%, that implies that there most likely overuse of Caesarean section. It may however also imply that there is still unmet need among certain population groups (e.g. the poorest women or rural women) in combination with overuse in other subgroups of the population (such as urban and richer women).\nPostnatal care (PNC) within 48 hours is provided to the mother/women and newborn. Country systems may have different ways of recording the type of PNC and also surveys are known to have data issues with PNC for the mother or the baby.2 Some countries use multiple definitions of timing of the PNC visit (e.g., within the first week).\nLow birthweight is a critical indicator of neonatal health. It is most meaningful if the distinction between prematurity and small-for-gestational age is made, but most facility reporting systems and most surveys do not have such data. All babies are supposed to have been weighed right after birth and the percent of newborns weighing less than 2500 grams is usually reported in the DHIS2 system. As general guidance for the interpretation of the data, low birthweight prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 13.9% (95% credibility interval: 12.4-15.7%) for 2020.3\n\n\n8.1.4 Immunization\nImmunization coverage indicators are included in virtually every country’s health sector monitoring plan. A general target is at least 90% coverage for essential vaccines given in childhood and adolescence.\nFor the national coverage analyses, the focus is on BCG, first and third doses of penta/DTP (penta1 or DTP1 and penta3 or DTP3), and first and second doses of measles vaccine, often given in combination with rubella vaccine. BCG and penta/DTP vaccinations are recommended to be given at birth (BCG), 6 weeks (penta1) and 14 weeks (penta3). For facility data, the number of vaccinations given to infants is used and the denominator is the number of eligible children in the population, which is approximated as live births minus neonatal deaths. Survey data generally provide vaccination coverage among children 12-23 months (may also include the age at which the vaccination was given – mostly before the first birthday).4\nThe first dose of measles vaccine is generally recommended at age 9 months. For the facility data, the recording and reporting usually separate measles given to children under 1 year and children 1 year and older, though the quality of recording and reporting for the age group may vary (there may be a tendency to record measles vaccinations after 12 months as given to infants). Here, we use children who have survived the first year of life (live births minus neonatal deaths minus postneonatal deaths) as the denominator for measuring vaccination coverage. The second dose of measles uses children aged 24-35 months as denominator. This can be estimated as live births minus neonatal deaths = 2* postneonatal deaths).\nWHO and UNICEF work with countries to produce annual estimates of immunization coverage based on all data sources. The national estimates, called WUENIC, are published and available for 2020-2024. These time trends are included in the Stata outputs, to compare the 2019-2023 annual estimates of the facility data produced in the workshop and the survey results.\n\n\n8.1.5 Family planning\nThe family planning coverage estimates are derived from a collaboration of the Countdown with Track20. Track20 has developed an advanced estimation tool called Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) which focuses on three indicators: modern contraceptive use, unmet need for modern contraceptives and demand satisfied with modern methods. The three indicators are closely related since demand is satisfied (this is the true coverage indicator) = use of modern contraceptives / (unmet need + use of modern contraceptives).\nFPET uses statistical modelling that incorporates all available data from surveys and may also use estimates obtained from facility data if the quality is sufficient.5 FPET allows for various types of survey data to be integrated into the estimates and fits a line that pulls from the trends. This utilizes the strength of multiple data points and minimizes the risk of comparing different surveys.",
