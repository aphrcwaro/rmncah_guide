Ce guide est destiné aux équipes analytiques des pays du Countdown afin de développer un ensemble d’estimations nationales et infranationales pour les indicateurs clés RMNCAH-N, y compris l’équité, en utilisant des séries chronologiques de cinq ans de données de routine et de résultats d’enquêtes.\nUne grande attention est accordée à l’obtention d’un ensemble de données propre avec les corrections et ajustements nécessaires pour les biais connus. La couverture des services et l’équité, la mortalité maternelle et périnatale, l’utilisation des services de santé et la performance des systèmes de santé sont les principaux sujets, l’accent étant mis sur le suivi des cibles nationales et infranationales, ainsi que des cibles mondiales. La figure ci-dessous montre l’aperçu général de l’approche CAM\nCe guide est organisé en sept sections, chacune se concentrant sur un domaine spécifique de l’analyse des données lié à la santé et à la nutrition reproductive, maternelle, néonatale, infantile et adolescente (RMNCAH-N). Le guide fournit une approche complète de l’analyse des données de santé de routine et des résultats d’enquêtes, en mettant l’accent sur la qualité des données, la couverture, l’équité et la performance des systèmes de santé.

R est le langage de programmation sous-jacent, tandis que RStudio fournit une interface conviviale qui simplifie le développement et l’exécution des scripts R. Les deux sont disponibles gratuitement et largement pris en charge sur toutes les plateformes.\nRemarque : R et RStudio ne sont pas la même chose. R est le langage de programmation, tandis que RStudio est un environnement de développement intégré (IDE) qui facilite le travail avec R.\nPour assurer une installation et une fonctionnalité fluides, il est recommandé d’installer R en premier, suivi de RStudio. Cet ordre est important car RStudio dépend de R pour fonctionner correctement.\n\n2.2.1 Étape 1 : Télécharger et installer R\nR est distribué via le Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Sélectionnez votre système d’exploitation sur la page d’accueil : Windows, Mac ou Linux.\nWindows\n\nAccédez à Download R for Windows et sélectionnez l’option “base”.\nCliquez sur le premier lien (par exemple, “Download R x.x.x for Windows”) pour télécharger l’installateur.\nExécutez l’installateur et suivez les invites. Des privilèges d’administrateur peuvent être requis.\nR sera installé dans les fichiers programme de votre système, avec un raccourci ajouté au menu Démarrer.\n\nMac\n\nCliquez sur Download R for Mac sur la page d’accueil du CRAN.\nTéléchargez le dernier package de version et exécutez l’installateur.\nLes paramètres d’installation par défaut sont généralement suffisants. Il peut vous être demandé de saisir votre mot de passe système.\n\nRemarque\nR n’est pas une application logicielle graphique mais un environnement de programmation. Il est préférable de l’utiliser conjointement avec RStudio, qui fournit une interface cohérente et conviviale sur tous les systèmes d’exploitation.\n\n\n2.2.2 Étape 2 : Télécharger et installer RStudio\nRStudio est un environnement de développement intégré (IDE) conçu pour R. Il dispose d’un éditeur de scripts, d’une console, d’un visualiseur graphique et d’outils supplémentaires pour la gestion des packages, le débogage et l’organisation des fichiers.\nTéléchargez RStudio depuis le site web de Posit\nAi-je toujours besoin de télécharger R ? Même si vous utilisez RStudio, vous devrez toujours télécharger R sur votre ordinateur. RStudio vous aide à utiliser la version de R qui réside sur votre ordinateur, mais il n’est pas livré avec une version de R propre.\nAprès l’installation, lancez RStudio et commencez à interagir avec R via sa console et ses fenêtres de script.",

The data are reported by health facilities on events such as immunizations given, or live births attended. As with any data, quality is an issue. Data needs to be checked to consider completeness of reporting by health facilities, identify extreme outliers and internal consistency. A standard reporting method for data quality allows assessment of progress over time.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nThe analysis of the monthly data by district for 2019-2024 is used to assess annual data quality using the following standard indicators: Reporting completeness, Outlier detection,Internal Consistency Data completeness, Ratios calculation, Overall quality score\nImplementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App",

To examine the association between ANC1 and penta1 is particularly informative. To compute and interpret indicators 3a and 3b the following considerations need to be made:\n\n\n\n\n\nANC1 to penta1 ratio\nWe can compute an expected ratio ANC1 to penta1 based on assumptions about mortality between early to mid pregnancy and early infancy and survey data on coverage of ANC1 and penta1 in the population:\n\nConsider the mortality between the first ANC visit and the first pentavalent vaccination.\n\nAssuming that ANC1 takes place at about 20 weeks or 4-5 months of pregnancy and penta1 at 6-8 weeks postpartum, we assume a pregnancy loss (abortion) after the ANC1 visit of 3%, a stillbirth rate of 2%, a twinning rate of 1.5% and neonatal mortality rate before the penta1 of 3% then the difference between the numbers of ANC1 and penta1 should be: \\[1 - 0.03 -0.02 + 0.015 - 0.03 = 0.935 \\]. This corresponds with a ANC1 to penta1 ratio of \\[1/0.935 = 1.07\\]\n\nActual population coverage of ANC1 and penta1 will also need to be considered, using the surveys.\n\nThe expected ratio (the number of ANC1/ number of penta1 in facilities) is 1.07 * (ANC1 coverage in the survey/penta1 coverage in the survey). If coverage for ANC1 and penta1 are the same, then the ratio is \\[ 1.07 (1.07 \\* 1/1) \\]\nBut if, for example, the last survey shows that ANC1 coverage was 90% and penta1 coverage was 95%, then the expected ratio becomes \\1.07 * (.90/.95) = 1.01*.\n\nFor the national ANC1 to penta1 ratio a range of plus or minus 0.05 outside this computed ratio is considered acceptable. If the ratio is outside this range, this should be flagged, and possible explanations discussed.\n\nPenta1 to penta3 ratio\nWe can compute an expected penta1 to penta3 ratio based on the most recent survey:\n\nThe main factor determining the penta1 to penta3 ratio, which are recommended at 6 and at 14 weeks of age, is the actual drop-out rate between penta1 and penta3, as mortality plays a limited role.\nPopulation coverage rates from the latest survey are used to determine the expected penta1 to penta3 ratio in the facility data. For instance, if penta1 coverage is 95% and penta3 coverage is 85%, we expect that ratio to be 0.95/0.85 = 1.12.\nAlso, here a range of plus or minus 0.05 is considered acceptable for the assessment of the facility data.\n\nThe Figure below produced in the ShinyApp shows the ratios for all six years (2019-2024) and the expected value. It will be important to reflect on large differences (e.g., more than 0.10 or 10%.).\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Overall DQA Score\nIn this section, the overall DQA score is calculated by considering the mean scores within some preselected data quality metrics as below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Performance\n\n\n\nIndicator\nNumerator\nDenominator\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual data quality score (mean 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3c, 3d)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is in this section that the first section report is downloaded capturing the key DQA indicators as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData quality assessment overall score\n\n\nReport:\nThe intepretation for this section should seek to answer the questions:\nPoints to consider for the interpretation\n\nIs there a data quality pattern by year for which there is an explanation?

Extreme outliers, such as an accidental extra zero in a number, can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers. Following the assessments, several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for analysis. This implies adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nIf we do not consider reporting completeness that means we assume all non-reporting facilities provided zero services, which is not likely to be true. Adjustments depend on how much services (e.g., pregnancy care, vaccinations) were provided at non-reporting facilities compared to those that reported. The adjustment factor k - defined as the ratio of the volume of services provided by non-reporting facilities to the volume of services provided by reporting facilities - is used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting.",

The factor k can be different for different services. For instance, if private facility reporting is poor but they are in the national system and they provide a considerable number of deliveries, k maybe greater than 0.25 or even as high as 1.0.\nThe following k-values are used depending on the reporting used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting:\n\nk=0 - No services in non-reporting facilities (default k-value)\nk=0.25 - Some services, but much lower than reporting facilities\nk=0.50 - Half the rate compared to reporting facilities\nk=0.75 - Nearly as much as reporting facilities\nk= 1.0 - Same rate of services as reporting facilities\n\nIf the facility reporting rate is below 75%, it becomes more difficult to impute district data. Therefore, no adjustments are made if reporting is lower than 75%. In that case, further analysis to determine coverage with the facility data is not considered sufficiently reliable.\nExtreme outliers, as defined in the previous section, will be corrected by imputing the median monthly value of the same year. The table summarizes the adjustments.\nTable 2: Summary of adjustments made to the raw health facility data in preparation of a clean data set for the endline analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\nAction\nAdjustment\n\n\n\n\nLow reporting rates: identifying low rates that were adjusted\nIf below 75% (default), data were imputed\nMedian monthly value for the district year was imputed for the month with low reporting\n\n\nIncomplete reporting by districts, variable over time, affecting trend assessment\nIf reporting rates were &gt;=75% and &lt;= 100% default), an assumption was made about the volume of services provided by the non-reporting facilities\nAdjustment factor k value was used to adjust for incomplete reporting k default value 0.25 (replace if different value used; state if used for all reporting forms or different k factors between forms)\n\n\nExtreme outliers can greatly affect coverage trend assessments\nIf a monthly value was greater or smaller than 5 times the median absolute deviation (MAD) from district monthly median value, an adjustment was made\nExtreme monthly outliers are corrected and given the district median value for the same year\n\n\nMissing values\nIf there is a missing value, data were imputed\nDistrict median monthly value for the year was imputed for the month with missing value",

Then, we assess the performance of multiple denominators options for the computation of population-based service coverage indicators from the health facility data. This should lead to a final decision on denominators that are used for the analyses of population-based coverage indicators based on health facility data.\nEach indicator has its own denominator, as shown in the table below.\nTable 3: Selected indicators with numerators and denominators\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

3ca019758b7b0acf9b278b3763a67c4e63921073\nIn the first part, we assess the quality of the DHIS2 population projections at national level:\n\nCheck the internal consistency of the DHIS2 population growth over time:\n\nCompute the population growth rate:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{pop}_{2024} - \\text{pop}_{2023}}{\\text{pop}_{2023}}\n\\]\nCompute the crude birth rate (CBR), defined as the number of live births per 1,000 population.\nExpect both growth rate and CBR to be consistent over time (e.g., less than 2 per 1,000 difference between years).\n\nCompare the population data in DHIS2 with the UN population projections at the national level:\n\nDifferences may occur, but large discrepancies suggest issues with DHIS2 population projections.\nThe comparison is done for four indicators. Abnormal values are flagged:\n\nPopulation size:\nA relative difference between DHIS2 and UN-projected population size greater than 5% indicates a data quality issue.\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{\\text{pop}_{\\text{DHIS2}} - \\text{pop}_{\\text{UN}}}{\\text{pop}_{\\text{UN}}} \\right|\n\\]\nPopulation growth during 2023–2024:\nAnnual growth is computed using the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{\\text{pop}_{2024}}{\\text{pop}_{2023}} \\right)\n\\]\nA difference greater than 0.3% (absolute) between DHIS2 and UN estimates is concerning.\nCrude birth rate (CBR):\nDefined as: \\[\n\\frac{\\text{projected live births}}{\\text{total population}} \\times 1000\n\\]\nA difference greater than 5 per 1,000 population compared to the UN estimate suggests a data quality issue.\nCrude death rate (CDR):\nDefined as:\n\\[\n\\text{CBR} - \\text{population growth rate}\n\\]\n(both expressed per 1,000 population). A negative CDR or a CDR &lt; 5 per 1,000 indicates inconsistency and potential data problems.\n\n\n\nThe second part is to select the best performing denominator for population coverage estimates with facility data. First, we compare the results for different denominators at the national level.\nFor the national level, we evaluate 4 denominator methods. The first two are projection methods (DHIS2 estimate and UN estimate), and the additional two are facility data- based methods ( ANC1-derived and penta1-derived denominators).\nNote\n\nFor the sub-national level, no UN projections are available, so we will use 3 methods only.\n\nThe maternal and newborn health denominators are closely related and can be computed from each other by making assumptions.\nStarting with pregnancies, the number of live births is closely associated with the number of pregnancies, which are usually identified within the health system at the first antenatal visit which in most countries is around 4-5 months of pregnancy (according to the surveys). Country specific values are preferred where available and can be obtained from the WHO website. The default assumptions are as follows:\n\nPregnancy loss between 4 and 7 months (28 weeks of pregnancy): 3%.\nStillbirths or pregnancy loss between 28 weeks and birth: 2%.\nTwinning rate: 1.5%. These first three steps give the number of live births computed from pregnancies.\nNeonatal mortality: 3% (or 30 per 1,000 live births).\nPost neonatal mortality (between 1-11 months): 2.4% (or 24 per 1,000 live births).\n\nThe selection of the best performing denominator method is based on a comparison of the performance of the DHIS2 projection and facility-data derived methods for two indicators: institutional live births and penta3. The gold standard is the population coverage rates from a recent survey, for a year as close as possible. The absolute difference between survey and facility-based coverage at national and sub-national levels is used to select the best performing indicator. (This can also be expressed as the number of standard errors from the survey value but this requires including the standard errors from the surveys - the results will be the same).\n\n7.2.1 Facility data derived denominators\nThe basic idea is that if the coverage of an indicator is high (e.g., over 90%), then the number of events reported by health facilities has to be close to the target population. In other words, the denominators or target population can be derived from the numbers in DHIS2. The best candidate indicators for this approach are ANC1 and DPT/penta1 (BCG also possible in some countries if re-vaccinations are recorded separately).\nThis approach requires the following:\nA recent population-based survey is used to obtain an estimate of population level coverage of ANC1 or penta1. For example, ANC1 coverage is 95% of pregnant women.\nThe DHIS2 data on the number of ANC1 and penta1 visits need to be considered complete and accurate (after adjustments / cleaning the data). For example, 100,000 ANC1 visits were reported.\nIf this is the case, then we only need to add the percentage that has not used the services (according to the survey results) to get the target population. For example, if ANC1 coverage from survey is 95% and the number of ANC1 visits from DHIS2 for the year is 100,000, the total number of pregnant women is: \\[ 100,000 / 0.95 = 105,263 \\]\nThe same approach can be used for DPT1 or penta1. The survey coverage is the percent of children 12-23 months who received DPT1/penta1, the facility data are the number of infants who received DPT1/penta1 vaccination. For example, if survey coverage is 92%, and there were 100,000 vaccinations given, then the \\[ denominator= 100,000 / 0.92 = 108,696. \\]\nThe number of live births can be obtained from ANC1 and DPT1 by making assumptions about pregnancy loss (abortion after the first ANC visit, stillbirths), twinning rates, and neonatal mortality. These steps are shown in the Figure below. ![] (images/1-dqa_denom_adjustment.png)\nAn example of ANC1:\n\nAbove we computed 105,263 pregnant women in the population\nat 3% abortion, this implies 105,263 * (1-.0.03) = 102,454 deliveries\nat 1.5% twinning rate this implies 102,454 / (1-(0.015/2)) = 103,229 births\nat 2% stillbirth rate this implies 103,229 * (1-0.02) = 101,164 live births\nat 3% neonatal mortality this implies 101,164 * (1-0.03) = 98,129 children eligible for DPT1/penta1.",

    "text": "8.1.1 Rationale, Approach and implementation\nRationale: Scientific basis for the analysis\nCoverage of interventions is a critical and direct output of health systems. Regular tracking of coverage at national and subnational levels has become the mainstay of monitoring progress in national health plans and international initiatives. Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health indicators with targets are the most common indicators of national health plans and global monitoring. Both health facility data and household surveys can provide coverage statistics, and an integrated analytical approach is desirable.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nMany coverage indicators can be estimated in both surveys and from health facility data. Both are critical pieces of information and need to be considered in conjunction with each other. The Table below lists the indicators, for antenatal and delivery care and child immunization, considered in the health facility data analysis in the workshop, including the variable names (in R) in the first column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName (in R)\nIndicator title\nSurvey d enomin ator\nFacility data den ominator\n\n\n\n\nAntenatal care\n\n\n\n\n\nanc1\nAntenatal care at least one or more visits among all pregnant women (%)\nWomen aged 15-49 years with a live birth in the last 2 years\nEstimated live births as d enominator\n\n\nanc_1 trimester\nAntenatal care 1+ visits in 1st trimester of pregnancy among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nanc4\nAntenatal care 4+ visits among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nipt2\nipt3\nIntermittent preventive therapy for malaria - 2nd dose / 3rd dose during pregnancy among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nifa90\nIron folic acid supplementation given (90 days supply) during pregnancy among all pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nhiv_test\nHIV test conducted among pregnant women (%)\nNot available (in some survey re ports)\n\n\n\nsyph ilis_test\nSyphilis test conducted among pregnant women (%)\n\n\n\n\nDelivery care\n\n\n\n\n\ninstd eliveries\nInstitutional live births among all live births\nLive births in the last 2 years\nEstimated live births as de nominator.\n\n\nsba\nSkilled birth attendance\n\n\n\n\nlo w_bweight\nLow birth weight (below 2500 grams) among all live births\n\n\n\n\ncsection\nC-section among all live births\n\n\n\n\npnc48h\nPostnatal care within 48 hours\n\n\n\n\nImmunization\n\n\n\n\n\nbcg\nBCG vaccination to infants\nChildren 12-23 months\nN of surviving infants (beyond neonatal period)\n\n\npenta1\nPenta vaccine - 1st dose to infants\nChildren 12-23 months\n\n\n\npenta3\nPenta vaccine - 3rd dose to infants\nChildren 12-23 months\n\n\n\nmeasles1\nMeasles vaccine - 1st dose (to infants)\nChildren 12-23 months\nN of surviving infants (beyond postNN period)\n\n\nmeasles2\nMeasles vaccine - 1st dose (older children)\nChildren 24-35 months\nN of surviving infants (beyond po stneonatal period) (or age 1)\n\n\n\nThe facility data can be used to generate annual coverage estimates, using the dataset for 2019-2024, through the Shiny App developed. These coverage results should be compared and interpreted alongside the results from recent surveys. The analysis results will include both coverage estimates.\nImplementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\n\n\n8.1.2 Antenatal care (ANC)\nMost countries have at least one ANC indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage targets for 2025 are: globally, at least 90% of pregnant women with 4 or more ANC care visits, and 90% of countries with at least 70% coverage. There are several ANC indicators that capture:\n\ncontact with health services during pregnancy (ANC 1st visit, ANC 4 or more visits, ANC first visit in first trimester). ANC1 is often considered an indicator of basic access to health services. It is high in most countries, and in many instances, the numbers of ANC1 visits in the routine health facility data can provide a better denominator for the ANC and delivery indicators than population projections (see section 2 on denominators).\ncontents of services provided (intermittent preventive therapy (IPT2 or IPT3) against malaria, HIV testing, syphilis testing and iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation (at least 90 tablets given to the pregnant woman)). Some countries will not have policies for all of these diagnostic or therapeutic interventions during pregnancy (e.g., no IPT if no malaria risk).\n\nFor most indicators, the surveys also provide coverage estimates for the national level, with 95% confidence intervals. For most coverage indicators the data refer to a period before the survey: e.g., institutional birth coverage for the live births in the two years preceding the survey. This means that the midpoint of the coverage estimate lies one year before the survey.\nAn example of two graphs for ANC, based on facility and survey data, is shown below, showing both good concordance between the facility-based and survey results for coverage of ANC first visit in the first trimester and poor concordance in case of ANC4 visits. In the latter case, it is evident that ANC4 is overreported in the facility data as coverage is much higher than the survey and unlikely to be high (over 90% during 2021-23 and even 101% in 2023). Poor recording and reporting of ANC 4th visits in the DHIS2 data is likely the main cause.\nSometimes, an indicator may reach an unlikely high coverage at the national level, say over 125%. This may be because the data quality of the numerator of the coverage indicator is poor, the denominator is wrong, or the intervention is given and recorded more than once during pregnancy. An example is IFA supplementation. In that case, the computation of coverage is not useful. It is better to express it differently. For instance, if coverage is 200%, it is better to compute the average number of courses of 90 IFA tablets that a pregnant woman received (in this case 2.0 per pregnant woman in the population).1\n![] (images/2-national-anc-cov.png)\n\n\n8.1.3 Delivery care\nAll countries have at least one delivery care indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage target for 2025 is at least 90% global average coverage, and 90% of countries at least 80% coverage of skilled birth attendance (SBA). For postnatal care (PNC) within 2 days the global coverage target is 80% and the 90% of countries with at least 60% coverage.\nInstitutional (live) birth coverage and SBA are closely related, as almost all deliveries with a skilled attendant occur in health facilities. From the analytical point of view, institutional birth coverage is preferred because it is a more objective measure and avoids issues with the definition of what constitutes skilled birth. SBA is often preferred from the health care perspective, as it includes an element of quality: obviously, an institutional delivery without skilled attendance is not desirable, and in some countries home SBA may be part of the health care delivery strategy. attendance. Either indicator works well to capture delivery care.\nCaesarean section is a live saving intervention and an important indicator. A general rule of thumb is, put forward by WHO, that in a population the need for Caesarean section is in the range of 10-15% of all deliveries. If the Caesarean section rate is below 10%, that means that there is unmet need. If the Caesarean section rate is over 10-15%, that implies that there most likely overuse of Caesarean section. It may however also imply that there is still unmet need among certain population groups (e.g. the poorest women or rural women) in combination with overuse in other subgroups of the population (such as urban and richer women).\nPostnatal care (PNC) within 48 hours is provided to the mother/women and newborn. Country systems may have different ways of recording the type of PNC and also surveys are known to have data issues with PNC for the mother or the baby.2 Some countries use multiple definitions of timing of the PNC visit (e.g., within the first week).\nLow birthweight is a critical indicator of neonatal health. It is most meaningful if the distinction between prematurity and small-for-gestational age is made, but most facility reporting systems and most surveys do not have such data. All babies are supposed to have been weighed right after birth and the percent of newborns weighing less than 2500 grams is usually reported in the DHIS2 system. As general guidance for the interpretation of the data, low birthweight prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 13.9% (95% credibility interval: 12.4-15.7%) for 2020.3\n\n\n8.1.4 Immunization\nImmunization coverage indicators are included in virtually every country’s health sector monitoring plan. A general target is at least 90% coverage for essential vaccines given in childhood and adolescence.\nFor the national coverage analyses, the focus is on BCG, first and third doses of penta/DTP (penta1 or DTP1 and penta3 or DTP3), and first and second doses of measles vaccine, often given in combination with rubella vaccine. BCG and penta/DTP vaccinations are recommended to be given at birth (BCG), 6 weeks (penta1) and 14 weeks (penta3). For facility data, the number of vaccinations given to infants is used and the denominator is the number of eligible children in the population, which is approximated as live births minus neonatal deaths. Survey data generally provide vaccination coverage among children 12-23 months (may also include the age at which the vaccination was given – mostly before the first birthday).4\nThe first dose of measles vaccine is generally recommended at age 9 months. For the facility data, the recording and reporting usually separate measles given to children under 1 year and children 1 year and older, though the quality of recording and reporting for the age group may vary (there may be a tendency to record measles vaccinations after 12 months as given to infants). Here, we use children who have survived the first year of life (live births minus neonatal deaths minus postneonatal deaths) as the denominator for measuring vaccination coverage. The second dose of measles uses children aged 24-35 months as denominator. This can be estimated as live births minus neonatal deaths = 2* postneonatal deaths).\nWHO and UNICEF work with countries to produce annual estimates of immunization coverage based on all data sources. The national estimates, called WUENIC, are published and available for 2020-2024. These time trends are included in the Stata outputs, to compare the 2019-2023 annual estimates of the facility data produced in the workshop and the survey results.\n\n\n8.1.5 Family planning\nThe family planning coverage estimates are derived from a collaboration of the Countdown with Track20. Track20 has developed an advanced estimation tool called Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) which focuses on three indicators: modern contraceptive use, unmet need for modern contraceptives and demand satisfied with modern methods. The three indicators are closely related since demand is satisfied (this is the true coverage indicator) = use of modern contraceptives / (unmet need + use of modern contraceptives).\nFPET uses statistical modelling that incorporates all available data from surveys and may also use estimates obtained from facility data if the quality is sufficient.5 FPET allows for various types of survey data to be integrated into the estimates and fits a line that pulls from the trends. This utilizes the strength of multiple data points and minimizes the risk of comparing different surveys.",

This is particularly important for drawing attention to populations who are left behind and ensuring resources are directed where they are most needed.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nThe focus should be on assessing the extent to which the country programs have succeeded in reducing the inequalities between regions/provinces and between districts, and the extent to which districts have reached a coverage target. Three global targets for coverage indicators are of particular interest:\n\nANC4: 80% of districts have at least 70% coverage (EPMM/ENAP)\nSBA or institutional delivery: 80% of districts have at least 80% coverage (EPMM/ENAP)\nPenta3/DTP3: at least 80% coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines (DTP – or pentavalent vaccine).\n\nThe regional and district analyses should use the best performing denominator for the coverage computations, as decided from the analysis in section 2 on denominators.

This is because district analyses are affected by small numbers (more fluctuations which may be random or due to data quality issues) and by the health service utilization patterns by women and children. For instance, a municipal district may get more deliveries than an adjacent rural district because of the location of the hospitals in the municipal district.\nThe key statistical measures for subnational inequalities are:\n\nMADM: median absolute distance from the median.

Equal weight is given to all indicators.\nSub-national statistical summaries\nThe aim is to produce a one-pager for each admin1 unit (generally region, province or county) that contains the regional information as well as a summary of the districts within the region. We refer to this as a regional subnational statistical summary.\nThe following components are included:\n\nSummary of key demographic information for the region and the districts: table with expected number of births in 2024 according to the DHIS2 projections and according to the preferred denominators derived from the health facility data (based on ANC1 for live births, and on penta1 for immunization indicators).\nLine graphs with the trend in coverage of institutional deliveries and penta3 vaccination that include the best estimates for 2020-2024 based on the health facility data, as well as the estimates from the most recent surveys (from 2015) for the same indicators (with confidence intervals if possible).\nBar graphs that compare the 2024 coverage situation in the region compared to all other regions, and puts the region into the lowest, middle or upper third of regions in terms of coverage.

Facility-based mortality statistics can also be a critical input into the estimation of population levels of mortality.\nReporting of maternal deaths, stillbirths, and early neonatal deaths (before discharge) may occur through the routine reporting system (DHIS2, aggregate or individual level) or be part of a maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response system (MPDSR).\nPopulation mortality statistics (maternal mortality ratio, stillbirth rates, neonatal mortality rates) rely on household surveys and censuses, with major limitations, especially for maternal mortality and stillbirths. A promising development is the major increase in health facility deliveries observed in many countries.\nEspecially if coverage of births in health facilities is high (e.g., over 75%), the facility-based statistics will become a useful input into the estimation of population levels of mortality. The main challenge with mortality data from health facilities is under-reporting of deaths. Maternal deaths do not only occur during birth, but also in pregnancy and post-partum.\nReporting of stillbirth deaths requires well maintained maternity registers, but also cross-checks to the operation theatre registers for cases of Caesarean section. If that is not the case, deaths may not be recorded in the maternity register, and not reported into the national system. In addition, maternal deaths occurring in other hospital wards are more likely to be missed, such as deaths associated with abortion, or post-discharge due to sepsis and other causes. Neonatal deaths after discharge, which is often within 24 hours, are also more likely to be missed.\nA critical step is a systematic assessment of data quality issues, which forms the basis for, if possible, adjustments, and more importantly should guide efforts to improve reporting quality.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nThe definitions for institutional, community and population maternal mortality and for stillbirths are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nNumerator\nDenominator\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional maternal mortality ratio (iMMR)\nNumber of maternal deaths in health facilities1\nNumber of live births in health facilities * 100,000\n\n\nPopulation maternal mortality (MMR)\nNumber of maternal deaths in the population\nNumber of live births in the population * 100,000\n\n\nCommunity maternal mortality ratio (comer)\nNumber of maternal deaths in the community\nNumber of live births in the community * 100,000\n\n\nInstitutional stillbirth rate (iSBR)\nNumber of stillbirths in health facilities2\nNumber of births in health facilities * 1,000\n\n\nPopulation stillbirth rate (SBR)\nNumber of stillbirths in the population\nNumber of births in the population * 1,000\n\n\nCommunity stillbirth rate (cSBR)\nNumber of stillbirths in the community\nNumber of births in the community * 1,000\n\n\nNeonatal mortality (before discharge)\nNumber of neonatal deaths before discharge\nNumber of live births in health facilities * 1000\n\n\n\n\n\n16.1.2 Data Analysis Components:\nData analysis has the following components:\n\n16.1.2.1 iMMR and iSBR review\nThe annual mortality rates are computed using the unadjusted data on reported deaths and births/live births in health facilities. We do not adjust for reporting rates and outliers (as is done for other interventions) because it is difficult to adjust maternal deaths and stillbirths, where the number of deaths is small and fluctuating.3 It is however advisable to check the data for any extreme outliers in the annual data (e.g., numbers of deaths that clearly indicate data entry errors) and replace these with the average of the surrounding years.\nThe figure below displays the institutional maternal mortality per 100,000 live births for regions (dots) and for the country as a whole (line and annual values) by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024\n\n\nSeveral considerations need to be made:\n\nAre there any extreme outliers on the high side which may be due to major data errors which need correction?\nHow many regions have implausibly low iMMR which is arbitrarily defined as less than 25 per 100,000 live births (25 is two times the MMR in high-income countries of 12.5); are these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or are there less-developed regions with low mortality, which could be an indication of major underreporting of deaths.\nA map with the iMMR by region/province would be a useful addition to guide the interpretation of the data, especially focusing on potential data quality issues.\n\nThe figure below presents the stillbirth rate per 1,000 births for regions and the country, using the same format as for maternal mortality. The interpretation should explain:\n\nHow many regions have implausibly low iSBR which is defined as less than 6 per 1,000 births (which is two times the SBR in high income countries)?\nAre these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or is this a sign of major under-reporting of deaths in less-developed regions of the country.\n\n\n\nInstitutional stillbirth rate per 1,000 births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024\n\n\n\nIn addition, the institutional mortality levels can be compared to the most recent mortality estimates for the population. These population estimates could be coming from a recent national survey or census, or we can use the UN estimates for maternal mortality (for 2020) and stillbirth rates (for 2021).\nThis is to obtain an idea of the difference between the institutional mortality and the population mortality. Interpretation should seek to explain:\n\nHow far is the iMMR (or iSBR) from the UN estimates of the population mortality, including the uncertainty range of the global estimates: this difference will be used further to assess the data quality.\n\nThe institutional neonatal mortality rates (per 1,000 live births) based on reported neonatal deaths may also be graphed similar to iMMR and iSBR, but have to be interpreted with additional caution. Almost all babies stay at least 24 hours after delivery in the hospital but after that many are discharged and the observation time in health facilities is variable. Therefore, the statistic is mostly referred to as neonatal deaths before discharge per 1,000 live births, which includes day 1, some deaths on day 2, fewer deaths on day 3 etc.\nA rough guide to assess reporting completeness is that expected mortality of neonatal deaths before discharge in health facilities should be at least half of neonatal mortality in the population. So for instance, if population neonatal mortality is 20 per 1,000 live births, we expect institutional neonatal mortality at least 10 per 1,000 live births in the health facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeonatal mortality before discharge per 1,000 live births in health facilities, based on DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions\n\n\n\n\n16.1.2.2 Data Quality metrics\n\nRatio stillbirth to maternal deaths in the health facility data at national level\n\nWe expect maternal mortality and stillbirth to be positively correlated given the commonalities in causes. Based on a review of the global estimates, historical data, and health facility studies, we expect the ratio of stillbirth to maternal death to be in the range of 7 to 30 for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We compute the ratio as the number of reported stillbirths divided by the number of reported maternal deaths in DHIS2 or MPDSR, in a specific time period (usually a year) and raise a “data quality flag” if the ratio is outside the 7-30 range.\nInterpretation:\n\nIf the ratio is lower than 7: under-reporting of stillbirths is likely greater than under-reporting of maternal deaths\nIf the ratio is equal or greater than 30: under-reporting of maternal deaths is likely to be the main issue, under-reporting of stillbirth less serious than for maternal deaths.\nIf the ratio is between 7 and 30: under-reporting of maternal deaths and under-reporting of stillbirths are both possible, or reporting of both is of good quality (this requires that the level is also in the expected range - component 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio of stillbirths to maternal deaths in health facilities, based on the reported data in DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions\n\n\n\nConsistency of institutional MMR with estimated population MMR and community MMR\n\nThe completeness of reporting by health facilities can be estimated by comparing the reported iMMR based on facility data with an expected iMMR. The population MMR, community MMR and institutional MMR should be consistent. There will be variation in the community to institutional MMR between populations, but it is not likely that, for instance, the community MMR is 1,000 when the institutional MMR is 100.\nWe compute an expected MMR in health facilities based on assumptions about:\n\nMMR in the whole population (including community and institutional deaths): For example, the lower bound, median, upper bounds of global estimates for each country (2023 UN estimates) could be used, or the results from a recent survey.\nRatio of community to institutional maternal mortality: We use assumptions ranging from 1.0 (where we assume community MMR is the same as iMMR) to 2.0 and 3.0 (cMMR is 2 or 3 times higher than iMMR).4 For each country, one should consider what this ratio could be which may depend on the proportion of births in health facilities. There is some evidence that the community to institutional ratio increases as institutional birth rates increases, as well as the observed percent of births in health facilities.\n\nThe population MMR is the sum of the institutional and community MMR, weighted by the percent of births occurring in facilities. For instance, if the institutional MMR is 100 and the community MMR is 200, and 75% of births are in health facilities, then the population MMR equals \\[ 0.75 * 100 + 0.25 *200 = 125  per 100,000 \\] live births. This can be expressed in the following formula:\n\\(M_{p} = P_{i}*M_{i} + \\left( 1 - P_{i} \\right)*M_{c}\\)\nWhere;\n\nMp = maternal mortality ratio in the population;\nMi = institutional maternal mortality ratio;\nMc= maternal mortality ratio in the community;\nPi the proportion of live births in institution\n\nHere, we have (1) iMMR from the DHIS2 data and (2) population mortality from the UN estimates, and can compute the community MMR as \\[(125 - 0.75 * 100) / (1-0.25) = 200 \\], or\n\\[ M_{c} =  \\frac{{(M}_{p} - {P_{i}*M}_{i})}{(1 - P_{i})}\\]\nIn the example, the ratio community to institutional mortality \\[(Mc/Mi) \\]equals 200 / 100 = 2, in other words the community mortality is two times higher than the institutional mortality.\nWe can now compute the expected MMR based on 1) an estimate of population MMR 2) the ratio Mc/Mi. For instance, if 75% delivers in health facilities, the population MMR is 200 and the ratio (Mc/Mi) is 2, then the expected institutional MMR is \\[ (200/(2-(2-1)*0.75) = 200 / 1.25 = 160 per 100,000 \\] live births. (and the community MMR is \\[320\\] ).\nIn a formula:5\n\nExpected \\[Mi =Mp / (Mc/Mi -- (Mc/Mi)-1) * Pi))\\]\n\nFinally, the completeness of facility reporting is reported iMMR (e.g. based on DHIS2) divided by the expected iMMR. For instance, if the reported MMR was 100 and the expected MMR 160, then the level of completeness of reporting is \\[100/160 * 100% = 62.5%.\\]\nBelow is an example of the estimated completeness of facility reporting of maternal deaths using different scenarios. The figure shows the results on completeness of reporting with three levels of population MMR (lower bound, median or best estimate, upper bound) and three community to institutional mortality ratios (0.5-2.5), shown on the X-axis.\nNot all scenarios are equally relevant to each country. For instance, if there is evidence that the population MMR is lower than the UN median, pick the scenario with the lowest MMR (the blue line). If it is considered that community MMR could be 1.5-2.0 times higher than institutional MMR, then the completeness estimate is 59-64%. The choices are arbitrary, but it is useful to consider if the range of estimates of completeness of facility reporting can be narrowed down by using the most plausible scenario. As default values, the ratios of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 are used.\n\nA similar approach can be used for stillbirths using all births instead of live births. The UN global stillbirth estimates for 2021 with uncertainty ranges can be used (lower and upper bound are 90% uncertainty intervals from the model). There is little research on the community to institutional stillbirth ratio (partly because community level stillbirth reporting is more uncertain) but it is likely that the ratios are lower than for maternal mortality, as institutional mortality levels are much higher for stillbirth rates than for MMR. A range of 0.5-1.5 may be used for the estimation of the level of completeness of facility reporting.",

For selected indicators, the assessment should focus on:\nNo health financing indicator:\nHealth financing indicators at the district or admin1 levels are difficult to obtain and are often limited to budget and not expenditures. The data also tends to be limited to government resources and may miss on other sources of financing. (These data are not used here, but if available, the financial data should be used to assess health system inputs.)\nCore health professionals per 10,000 population:\nHealth workforce indicators are often of poor quality and not easy to obtain. The main indicator is the number of core health professionals per 10,000 population. These include physicians, non-physician clinicians (depending on the country, but often with surgical skills and multiple years of training but no academic degree), nurses and midwives.\nIn 2006, WHO suggested that at least 23 core health professionals were needed to make major progress in reducing maternal and child mortality with high skilled birth attendance. More recently, higher thresholds have been used: at least 44.5 per 10,000 population to achieve universal health coverage.\nNumber of health facilities per 10,000 population:\nHealth infrastructure is another useful indicator, including all hospitals, health centers and lower level health facilities such as health posts and dispensaries. Both private and public sectors should be included. The number of health facilities per 10,000 population is a crude indicator as it mixes small and large facilities (2 per 10,000 could be used as an indicative number, where less than 2 is considered low).\nNumber of hospitals per 100,000 population and number of hospital beds per 10,000 population:\nAdditional insights into the infrastructure for in-patient services can be obtained by computing the number of hospitals per 100,000 population and by the number of hospital beds per 10,000 population.\nFigure: Number of hospitals per 100,000 population, by region and national\nFigure: Number of hospital beds per 10,000 population, by region and national",

While routine health facility data are intended to capture private sector service delivery—such as the number of deliveries or family planning visits—this information is often incomplete, as reporting from private facilities tends to be less consistent than from public ones. Ideally, all private facilities should be included in the master facility list, but this is frequently not the case.\nTo estimate the private sector’s contribution more accurately, survey data such as those from DHS and MICS can be used. These surveys include questions about the source of health services, distinguishing between public and private providers.\nApproach: Description of analytical steps\nIn this analysis, we use three key indicators to assess the private sector’s role at the national level and disaggregated by urban and rural residence.\nThe three indicators are:\n\nDeliveries: Percent of live births occurring in health facilities among all live births in the last two years, by public private; with the share that is private\nSurgical interventions: Percent of C-sections that occur in health facilities among all live births in the last two years, by public private; with the share that is private\nCurative care for children: Percent of children under-five who have sought care for fever, acute respiratory illness or diarrhoea in the last two weeks before the interview, by public private; with the share that is private\n\nIt is generally expected that women and children in urban areas rely more on privately provided services than those in rural areas.\nThere are, however, two caveats to the interpretation:\n\nRural women may use private services located in urban areas, which means that the percentage of women / children is overestimated for rural residents.\nThe distinction between private-for-profit and non-profit private facilities is not made in this analysis. Each country uses a different classification and naming convention, and also for the survey respondent this distinction is difficult to make.\n\nImplementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App\nThis can be analyzed using the Health System Performance tab -&gt; Private sector as shown in ?fig-hs_performance.",
